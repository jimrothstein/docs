Dear Dr.  Lam and Dr.  Carl:

First, greatly appreciate your assistance and efforts.   It would be a big help
if we could develop a plan to incorporate your ideas and then exexecute it.

I would also like this plan to include assessment of various organs/processes
that have yielded unusual results to date and decide what actions, if any, are
appropriate.

My short list includes:

- Urinary Oxalate.
- Pancreas, pancreatics atrophy, stool fat.
- Kidneys (even if absence of stones).
- Parathyroid.
- GI, inlcuding possibilty of bacteria + fat malabsoprtion.
- Utility of various prescriptions/supplements.

Maybe not a short list.   However, all have emerged as related to Urinary Oxalate and
I have been unable to understand which should be treated or not.

Before proceeding, I want to be sure I understand "what problem we are trying
to solve," and I can read the evidence that any proposed intervention has been
successful.

*	urine oxalate variation
* hyperparathryoid symtoms

Below are a few misc pieces of information that came up in phone call with one or both of you.
kidney oxalate https://www.kireports.org/article/S2468-0249(18)30171-2/pdf
But wanted to mention a few things:
-	KCitrate - daily dose 
-	Vitamin D3, Now: ~15,000 IU per WEEK.   
- Vitamin D3, (2017? - spring 2020):   27,000 IU per Week, per OSHU to correct parathyroid
		(did not work)
- Calcium Supplement - ~1000 - 1200 mg per DAY, w/o D3 (plus dairy, dietary sources)
- Hydrothazide (2008? ) - will try to find records. (Attached pls see lab results)
- Low Salt Diet   -- long long time (not perfect though)
- Low Oxalate Diet  - try, but doubtful I am compliant. (healthy foods often rich in Ox);
		limited effect on 24-hour urine  Ox.

- Coe:
- Mayo Clinic
- Litholink:  Must have the best data on urine chemistry, if he is willing to share it.
- All....   Clinic trial , but lacked diagnosis.
