To:

**House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol**



I write to thank the Committee for your efforts to uncover the people and
funding responsible for creating the situation ripe for a violent mob to attack the US Capitol
on January 6, 2021.

I wish you complete success.  But it also appears very clear that you will
face unending and deliberate obstacles.

To accomplish your goals, you must remain as determined, resourceful and as
smart as those who wish to hide and deny.  One way or another you must find a
way forward.

In this, I believe you have overwhelming support of our citizens.

I look forward to televised hearings in the new year.


Thank you.
