<p>– Dear Jo:</p>
<p>I received your email after 5 Friday and immediately called you.</p>
<p>Today, Saturday, I cleaned the desks and area around me, as well as removed my coffee cups and related paraphilia. (I use and clean my 16 oz cups because of a kidney condition and need for substantial hydration; I will use the office cups.) Also any fruit/salads are back in refrigerator. (The office refrigerator is now cleaned every Friday, so I temporarily remove any salads/fruits that I want to keep.</p>
<p>I am not sure if I have met you. Until fairly recently, I was not aware of any criticism. When Kristine asked me to remove boxes, I did so. Since then, Kristine has entered (for mail) and Tom has chatted with me, but neither pointed out any issues.</p>
<p>Not meant as an excuse, there have been stretches where I seemed to only one using the room. I may have adopted less than perfect habits. Perhaps what one manager finds unacceptable, another does not.</p>
<p>All of this can be fixed. Please do not jump to conclusions.</p>
<p>When I am in the room, my door is often open. If something is not quite right, please tell me. I will come in earlier than usual on Monday to fix anything still not order.</p>

– let it go; pointless to harp on these issues (not going to win) - what clothes?

- Use place like library, wouldn’t leave shirt on chair overnight| would dry things on adjacent table in library (even if nobody there). - Bottom line: better to KEEP this place, then NOT. Don’t argue with them or show their own hypocricy (“safety …” fix the ventilation!) &gt; }}}</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="r-20-aug-2020-lysol-trash-covid-19-ventilation">R 20 AUG 2020 ; lysol, trash; covid-19, ventilation</h2>
<p>August 20, 2020</p>
<p>Dear Kristine:</p>
<p>You asked me to summarize our conversation yesterday:</p>
<p>Trash.</p>
<p>I will ask cleaning people (Jenny/Alex) to return to the normal procedures; I won’t touch the trash.</p>
<p>Furniture.</p>
<p>No problem with any rearrangement. If you can give me an hour or two notice, I can be elsewhere.</p>
<p>Ventilation.</p>
<p>By ventilation I mean regular airflow, i.e.&nbsp;removal of stale older air and replacement with either fresh outside or filtered air. In general the northwest corner of building has less air circulation. I have reported this before. It is less of a problem in winter, but quite noticeable in summer. covid-19 adds to everyone’s concerns.</p>
<p>Opening the door to northwest hallway does seem to improve flow. I still smell the cleaner, but it is diminished.</p>
<p>Temperature.</p>
<p>During normal working hours, I do not have any problem with temperature, as long as I keep my door closed. Hallway is warm. After the 5 pm, things warm up quite a bit, but I understand that</p>
<p>Lysol smell.</p>
<p>The two cleaning people work very hard. Alex said he follows the direction of his boss and used lysol, but did not have the container. The lysol company makes a large number of lysol products and some have been approved for covid-19 use.</p>
<p>If they are required to use strong cleaners, of course I can stay away (with some notice.) but I hope this can be infrequent and less than 24 hours.</p>
<p>However, I am not the only with strong dislike for this odor or the length of time it remains in the air.</p>
<ul>

<li><p>https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/dhpjmw/lysol_smellfrom_hell/</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Apparently, lysol can cling to clothes, carpets, car seats.</p>
<p>Just fyi:</p>
<p>Covid-19 cleaners.</p>
<p>[ The CDC website offers 3 cleaning suggestions, including soap and water.] ( https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/reopen-guidance.html)</p>
<p>[FDA: Hand Sanitizers] (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-drug-class/qa-consumers-hand-sanitizers-and-covid-19)</p>
<p>[EPA approved for Covid-19] (https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2-covid-19)</p>
<p>Also, the EWG evaluates products for health and environment products. Some lysol are very good but some receive failing grades.</p>

<p>Ask Kristine about Mask in ‘shared space.’ She isn’t sure, will check, but then says it is ‘his office’ and we do not require it. I point out ‘shared office’. And I ask if wearing mask includes ‘nose’- yes, she says.</p>
<p>She then repeats that it is ‘his office’ and I say ‘yeah, but I dont want virus.’ She says she will check, but maybe “you need to WORK FROM HOME.” (emphasis added.)</p>

<p>29 Nov 2020</p>
<p>Dear Kristine:</p>
<p>I have modified my work hours to arrive earlier and leave earlier.</p>
<p>The janitors are correct I am often here between 10 pm and 3 am. My routine has been to arrive late and leave late (please see email 21 May 2020). But as I understood these words, I do not reside here, I am not here overnight. When I am not working, I am not here.</p>
<p>I think you said that the last sentence of House Rule 9 was either re-interpreted or modified.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rule 9 “Employees and Guests”</li>
<li>… “No part of the office or Business Center may be used for overnight accommodation.” [Jan 2020]</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously I want comply with rules. You mentioned you had additional documentation to clarify Rule 9. This would be very helpful.</p>
<p>Please let me know when you have questions or additional complaints. The sooner I am aware, the sooner I can address these.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>971-327-4133. - Kerry calls, l/m, said she’d call again in PM. - I call l/m (~10, 11 am?) Asked again she try to send email. - No other calls or voicemails, so ~4:30 pm, I leave her a second msg . - ~4:20 pm ? I call her. She calls back. - Says she rec’d my email to Kristine, but doesn’t seem to know content. - Best I can piece together: 24-hour access means “access”. Working late at night is violation of their lease with building and is not what they mean by “access”. So it is violation of my lease. - Ok, I ask for definitions, rules …. Seem to go in circles and I at one point I say she sounds like a politican. - At other points, she seems to throw out … 1 night is ok, but not every night; 10 - 11 pm is ok, not too far from normal working hours.<br>
- I keep saying telling me the rules, what hours are ok or not? Told her Kristine said there was documentation on this. - She says janitors say you enter and leave building. Yes, I try to stay out there way. - At one point she says, you here now (&gt; 4pm) and you were here (10 am) and you were till 3 am ….. cut her off, “Didn’t you read the email?” - So more circles, read the email! Asking for clarification. - Change to new topic: I say don’t want to make a big case out of it; I changed hours. I try to respond. - Point out: more than one way to discuss things that Regus doesn’t like, nicer ways. Said she understood. Pointed out: first year, I didn’t seem have any problems. She mentioned new manager. Said now it seems like everything I do is wrong. - Since we are talking: my memos re: ventilation or especially cleaning at beginning of covid. All go unanswered. it takes 2. - Ask to clean carpet, spots pre-date. Said they’d consider spot cleaning or whatever. - Wast of time. But believe am OK for now. Just stay on schedule they prefer or best I can interpret that (leave 10, 11) which she mentioned.</p>

Call Cap1 ask them to <code>block</code> charges from Regus, not a dispute - there is NO charge yet.</p>
<p>Note: back to Regus corporate (send via regular email to help desk AND via their website … pretty poor)</p>
<p>Thank you for the response. I remain concerned that I have conflicting information: locally, Regus says it is not renewing my lease. My last day is May 31, 2021.</p>
<p>However, you have invoiced for June rent. It can not be both - non-renewal and pay for rent.</p>
<p>On Monday, May 10 I emailed the local Regus management for clarification. On Tuesday, May 11 I emailed Regus head of customer support. As this time, neither has responded.</p>
<p>You are scheduled to draw funds, per April 30 invoice, on May 15, 2021.</p>
<p>Since this may not be resolved to everyone’s satisfaction in the limited time, I have asked my bank not accept new charges from Regus.</p>
<p>I am happy to pay the invoice, if and when this is worked out. Please notify the appropriate people at Regus that the payment set for May 15 will not go through.</p>
<p>I do owe for April coffee ($30) and will make arrangement to pay you for this. (Please stop all coffee fees – Regus offers it complementary).</p>

<li>Payment has been done automatically for years!</li>
<li>Apparently they changed their system and did not get payment. Claimed they had old phone number and the email must have gone to my spam folder (bullshit – I get invoices every month by email.)</li>
<li>Claimed can not legally move CC info from one system to another. Ok, but again this is YOUR change. Said he would try to waive late fee, but not sure.</li>
<li>He kept repeating they tried to contact me …. I am responsible for payment ….blah blah blah. I added this is annoying.<br>

<li>When I said I authorize only the past due ($49 for June) and ($49 for July) he interrupted, said I was being belligerent and HE hung up.</li>

<ol type="a">
<li><p>If Lessee does not vacate the leased premises at the time required, Lessor shall have the option to treat Lessee as a Lessee from month-to-month, subject to all of the provisions of this lease except the provisions for term and renewal. Failure of Lessee to remove fixtures, furniture, furnishing or trade fixtures which under this lease shall constitute a failure to vacate to which this paragraph shall apply if the property not removed will substantially interfere with occupancy of the premises by another Lessee or with occupancy by Lessor for any purpose, including preparation for a new Lessee. Lessee’s monthly rent shall automatically increase to an amount equal to 150% of the last month’s rental rate during the specified lease term, for any holdover period.</p></li>
<li><p>If a month-to-month tenancy results from a holdover by Lessee under this Paragraph 17.3, the tenancy shall be terminable at the end of any monthly rental period on written notice from Lessor, given not less than TEN (10) days prior to the termination date which shall be specified in the notice.

<p>Honorable Oregon Congressional Delegation: Senator Ron Wyden Senator Merkley Reprsentative Val Hal</p>
<p><strong>Is Sunshine the Best Disinfectant?</strong></p>
<p>Ocasionally, a political event is so piercing that it can not be ignored: A Supreme Court justice unable or unwilling to comply with customs and laws of our nation or even some sense of ‘fair play’ is no longer fit to serve.</p>
<p>I am well aware that real change in our country usually occurs only when significant number of American people demand it and are willing to spend years and decades fighting for it. I am also well aware corruption at highest level of our government shocks few people.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I urge you to lead in a forceful and permanent repsonse.</p>
