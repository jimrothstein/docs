<p>Peter the Great (1689 - 1725) kicks out Swedes, makes St.&nbsp;Peter’s capital. Academy (1724), esp for math, attracts Euler, Bernoulli.</p>
<p>1730 - 1745, turmoil, trials, executions, till Catherine the Great, Euler returns. (Berlin Academy - Fred the Great, ego but not so great, after 7 years war: famine)</p>

<li>~1852 Russia expansionary; considers itself true defenders of religion; in Holy Land, Russians considered pious visitors, but French are merely ‘tourists’. Russia eyes Ottman, while Fr &amp; UK, despite own suspicions of each other, prop up Ottoman to block Russians.</li>

<p>Great Terror - show-trials, Bukharin, Lev Kamenev, Zinoviev, Alexi Rykov, but Pasternak (born 1890) asks why spared?</p>

<li>1852 SPARK. Unruly pilgrims, not so pious… Nicholas I extends protection. Napolean III (?) seeking support of Fr Catholics also steps in; French warships to Holy Land. Now UK is nervous.</li>

<li>Gentry, landed Gentry: upper class, but not nobles or church, inherited land, able to live by collecting rent. Some actually wealthier than nobles.
1649 - Charles I beheaded (impeached) 1684 - James II (Catholic) succeeds brother Charles II. 1689 - William III (from Netherlands) removes James II . <strong>Glorious Revolution</strong> was actual neither. Replaced one king with another - EXCEPT King no longer sovereign but <strong>constitutional monarch</strong> meaning beholden to English people(really?) and not elected by GOD. <strong>Whig</strong> triumph (ie aristocrats, oppose Catholic rule)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hobbes - man selfish interests, BUT capacity to REASON and realize collective strength is the safest for all. So Hobbes actually is pro-monarchy b/c stability. 1616-1633 Gaelio battles Church. Spinoza - Dutch Jew. Independent path. Locke - man is individual. Different between richest and poorest is only education, wealth … Babies start with blank slate. life, freedom, happiness …. unclear his view of property. At one point, each should have enough … but elsewhere seemed to not rule out amassing property (then called estates ?) and perhaps first capitalist - UNCLEAR. Also tolerant (well, maybe not for Catholics, jews)</p>

<p>Poor farmers refuse to pay whiskey tax that fed govt issues to raise money. Some violence in and round Pittsburgh.<br>
Whiskey Rebellion - Washington eventually sent 13,000 troops to supress ‘western rebellion’ and enforce the tax colllection. But the rebels vanished into western PA hills. No further attempt was made to collect the tax.<br>
Who cares? Federalist party and idea of stronger central govt began to disappear . Until the Civil War, local and State’s rights ruled the day.,</p>

<p>Unconstitutional, but based on perceived threat from French revolutionaries and fellow-travelers to topple Federalist govt (Adams), was seldom used but left a taint to Federalist brand. After Hamilton murder, Federalist were all but gone. (Federalist prefered England’s stability to Jefferson’s support for anti-Monarchy French revolutionaries</p>
<ul>
<li>removes many parochial, arthritic European structures like local tariffs, reduces number of German municipalities, etc. setting environment <code>more friendly</code> to industrial revolution.</li>
<li>France, Germany, USA … also contributed to technological improvements, not just England. Empirical fact(?): more capital per worker, more GDP per worker. Why is Peru <code>poor</code>, cheaper to use 19th C inventions b/c cheap labor, its GDP/Capital is about where England was in 19th.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>after period of rapid growth, esp.&nbsp;land.</p></li>
<li><p>by 1837, deep depression; one of worst in US history.</p></li>
<li><p>US is dominated by England, for capital, for markets (cotton), and for imports.</p></li>
<li><p>Several states default (not US govt) and state govt debt is <strong>sovereign</strong>, can not sue for it in its own state court.</p></li>
<li><p>English bankers get pissed at defaults: see what happens in democracy; lose all values of paying one’s debts. If US cotton crop fails, English factories layoff -&gt; English recession and then of course no demand for US cotton the next year. Very tight ties bet US and London bankers.</p></li>
<li><p>Lessons? Without hegemony, US or any country can not separate its domestic and foregin policies. Longer term changes, US States get out of capital improvement projects (ie less public bonds, let private section do this), States begin to deploy property tax to raise revenues (and less sales of land) ## Pennsylvania RR</p></li>

<li><p>ditto for birth control b/c reduces children of ‘unfit’ classes. Spencer prefers ‘survival of fitest’: why waste money/reforms on lower classes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bryan - sounded like Fundamentalist. Not quite. His objection to evolution: IF man incapable of rising above lower animal instincts, then SOCIAL REFORMS (ie done by us imperfect people) DOOMED to fail. More modern (?) social reforms necessary to CONTROL worst of human animal side. ???</p>
<p>Scopes - Though Bryan initially won in court, the decision was actually overturned on appeal (technical issue). Then appeals court closed case, without clear resolution on the main issue. Should religious doctrine (CREATION) be allowed in public school was never argued?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reaction: North saw victory (Bryan had looked out-of-touch); became less vigilant. South: rise of anti-evolution. Backlash. What had not been much of issue, became a southern cause.</p></li>
<li><p>Ex: 1921 - Darwin on cover of Biology books. 1926 edition -he is gone. Evolution removed from southern textbooks. LESSON: do not put your teachers on trial, just change books. True today! Report (1936) Biology <span class="citation" data-cites="1900">@1900</span> had more science than 1936. Creation remained LAW in many states; Texas much of 20C and certainly after 1980s.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>J. Howard Pew</strong> (Sun Oil) capitalism and religion do NOT conflict. Use of religion in conservatism. Prior mostly just rich, anti-New Deal, or ideology (Ann Ryan, a few university profs). Pew wants return to fundamentalism. Opposes Niebuhr and liberal Christian ideology.</p>
<p><strong>Billy Graham</strong> (1955)</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>6/14/1914 -assassination<br>
</p></li>
<li><p>Schlieffen Plan - Paris in 4 weeks; then Russia in 4 months; Route through Belgium, not directly from Alasce into France b/c too well fortified. But Belgium resists more than expected. Gen Ludendorff uses new gun and breaks through. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlieffen_Plan</p></li>
<li><p>But Russians move too soon. DUO of Ludendorff and older, aristocrat Hindenberg defeat Russians by analyzing the two Russian armies and defeat them separately. <strong>Battle of Tannenberg</strong> However, what appeared as military success violates Schlieffen Plan. Germany faces <strong>TWO FRONT WAR</strong> Argument Germany could have sued for peace and everyone could have gone home.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rathenau</strong> Jewish industrialist; brilliant planner; and keeps Germany economy afloat. Not why did the war take 4 years, but how did Germany survive for 4 years.</p></li>
<li><p>East or West, Kaiser dithers between 1914 and 1916 while military asks him to choose which one first. Falkkenhayn (military leader in charge) says East; Ludendorff says West.</p></li>
<li><p>Faced with no choose, Falkkenhayn devises Verdun Plan, control area around <strong>Verdun</strong> and bleed the city dry. Falkkenhayn [^1] is realist and able general, but this is a Military failure; almost equal deaths; pointless as French General activates superhuman logistics effort. Falkkenhayn now replaced with Ludendorff. Post Verdun Ludendorff + Hidenberg as figure head in control. Will control army + govt as effective military dictatorship. :<br>
:[^1] FALK also sought political way to end war; Russia was not favorable and German diplomats not eager; another failure.</p></li>
<li><p>Turnip Winter (1916-17) 1916</p></li>
<li><p>British blockade Germany; Germans down to 1000 cal/d, starving. (German army always had enough to eat, unlike Russian army, German general and aristocracy clueless about actual conditions in population. England has enough food sources no starvation.</p></li>
<li><p>Haber tells Ludendorff can produce enough fertilizer or poison gas NOT both. His wife is so upset with what her husband does she commits suicide. 1918 Germany.</p></li>
<li><p>Whatever Ludendorff asks, the German people provide. It was never for enough for Ludendorff who had no understanding of people, soldiers, war, death, starvation. He is to blame; not the German people. Ludendorff regarded as brilliant tactician (Take that hill!) but absolutely clueless how to defeat an army or win a war.<br>
Russian General Brusilov defeats Austrian army (date, significance?)</p></li>
<li><p>Claim in 1916 Germany could have very reasonable peace deal. Ludendorff either intimidated a weaker Kaiser or fooled him and the industrialist class, as well as the people that great victory lie ahead. A big lie.</p></li>
<li><p>March ’18 German military almost breaks French-British line in France. High point.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oct ’18 German Revolution begins? Reason why Ludendorff sees loss?</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="durrs-of-alabama-outside-the-magic-circle">Durrs of Alabama “Outside the Magic Circle”</h2>
<p>Virginia Foster Durr (1903- ) remarkable; able to cast aside upbringing.{{{ Influencial whites through racial, liberal causes of 1st half 20th century. Knew: Mary McLeod Bethume, Studs Terkel, Linus Pauling, Eleanor Roosevelt, oppposed Poll Tax; apposed HUAC; apposed Truman’s loyalty oath (1946 - claimed it was to get ahead of HUAC and NJ Rep Parnell Thomas); supported Henry Wallace; brother-in-law Hugo Black (liberal ??)</p>
<p>Not merely her views, but she (and lawyer husband Cliff Durr) took active stances that made enemies; hurt them financially; politically. Remember taking a stance agasint poll tax in Alabama will not make Senator xxx (Eastland) like you, who in 1941 called her to testify and asked “Are you a Communist?” (1st whiff of what was to come.</p>
<p>1938 - Radicalized by LaFollette Hearings re: crushing labor unions. New Deal Washington DC draw in people with idealism, ideas and cultivated social environment that encouraged BEST in professionals who joined New Deal (everyone cleared out when FDR died)</p>
<p>SCHW: Organized black and white conferences, such as one in Montgomery ALA, attended by Eleanor, and condemned by BULL CONNOR</p>
<p>Highlander Folk Camp;</p>
<p>1941 - Claude Pepper - FL - sponsor anti-poll tax</p>
<p>Durrs targeted by FBI, red-bating; Cliff headed National Laywers Guild, that NIXON attached. Cliff, fired by Truman’s loyality oath; represents people fired becuase of the oath. Cliff, who no longer can hold federal job, represents poor blacks.</p>
<p>With Linus Pauling, signed petition to not bomb above Yalu River. This led to her being ostracized in high of red scare.</p>
<p>1955 - Along with local activist (Nixon?), Durrs help bale out Rosa Parks. SNCC;</p>

<li>Russia Hawks, GOP &amp; Hoover, Russia will dominate a weak China; must negotiate with Japan asap before Russia enters war against Jap. Russia is now bigger fear. On other hand, as against Hitler, let Russia take the caualties to fight Japan.</li>
<li>Other US factors: US pop is war weary; GOP pillared Wilson for pursuing 14th points rather than unconditional German surrender. Iwo Jima/Okinawa (April - June 22, 1945): ferocious Jap fighting. 1942 elections: Dem lose 45 in H, 9 in Senate: New Deal in retreat.</li>
<li>Marshall (Army Chief of Staff) <code>thinker</code>: invasion necessary for Jap surrender. Stimson (War), Know (Navy)</li>
<li>Japanese: Togo (Foregin Minister): end war NOW, but all other seek a battle victory before negotiating. Military (fight, fight till win): plan to mobilize entire nation, including suicides. Generally, Japanese feel time on their side, attrition hurts US more than Jap; buys time.</li>
<li>June 8, 1945. Susuki, now head of state, reaffirms fight, not negotiate.</li>
<li>Then Kido (head of govt) plan (doomed) withdraw from former EU colonies, ask Russia to mediate; this is “daring” attempt to modify Jap Army plan. didn’t happen.</li>

<p>Fulton: Churchill speak for war; at time many criticized; Truman, present, also not pleased.</p>
<p>1946 - most US scientists: what have we done? DEBATES: Share knowledge? Cooler heads knew Russians would catch up; but hawks rise. Truman disliked Oppenheimer; things Russians will “never” catch up. Influence by his own racial prejudices. Truman captured by hawks does not even want to share with British. Acheson-Litelton (influenced by Oppenheimer) - share bomb with world, to manage it. Barauch presents to UN (6/46), aging, poor choice, did not believe tenets himself. AEC: civilan control of US bomb, not military.</p>

HUAC reauthorized every year. - Hollywood unions &gt; 1935, mixed: some good, some not; SCOTUS: Hollywood IS subject to 1935-Wagner Act (artists originally exempt) - Many in Hollywood sympathetic to progressive causes (range, in dedication). Several wrote scripts with references in some way to good causes, in movies otherwise very non-political. Smallest of big 5 was RKO and most liberal: Dore Schary “Until the time it is proven that a C- dedicated to overthow of gov’t, I can not determine any ground for hiring but, by the man’s competance.” But many faced backlash from Right hysteria for their views. Others supported by money, by organizing others, by penning comment here and there. Maybe one or two card-carrying C-, but most sympathetic to various progressive views, or simply wanted their work to be truthful, some simply anti-Nazi.</p>

They claim to be super-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise but their spokesman for monopoly and vested interests. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using power of the state and the power of the market simultaneously, they may keep the common man in eternal subjection.</p></li>

<li><p>1945 (late August) war over. Birch and party stopped by Communists (not something unusual or alarming). But Birch is tired, weary from war … makes threatening move and is killed. A tragety , but not a hero. his fault.</p></li>

Replace old man, Wright Patman (D-TX), 1928-1972, who believed in preventing monopoly power. He was last of generation like Brandeis who oppposed bigness, concentrated power (though may be different reasons). In 1930s, he passed law to prevent A&amp;P, chain store, from offering various discounts, rebaits that made mom&amp;pop difficult to compete against. He had no problem with “efficiency”, or that mom&amp;pop could offer better service. He opposed concentrated power to UNFAIRLY change playing field. That was “fair trade” meant in 1930s.</p>
<p>Both Hofstader and Galbrieth praised big business! H- argued American triumph &amp; prosperity due to big corporations. G- did not focus on <code>class struggle</code>, is that Liberal means?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>even in 1940s did not associate “liberalism” as first step to Communism, but “proud” to keep Communists out of his union. But in ‘50s more pro-business, against govt intervention’. Goldwater speach “time for choosing” said nothing about social issues. By 1966, sees opportunity to go attack to attach LBJ’s great society and SOCIAL ISSUES for first time (crime, welfare, persmissive society criminals have more rights than victims ) Not racist, just govt should have no role in making balance. Voting Rights Act “humiliation” for South; he opposed it b/c opposed to gov’t intervention, not racism. His pro-ERA, pro-abortion, tighter gun control positions as gov. would all vanish in 1970s as <em>single issue social issues</em> backlash.</p></li>
<li><p>saint today, but in 1980 was 3rd choice of GOP. Party split, grudingly adopt him after success in primaries. vs.&nbsp;Goldwater, Reagan was “sunny”, BG “dour”; policies are same. vs.&nbsp;anti-Red 1950s, he was (now) upbeat, folksy. So sunny he could rail against ‘reverse racism’, ‘affirmative action’ and turn it into a dog whistle by emphasising <em>just want to be fair</em> and <em>without Welfare Queeens</em> (I don’t remember him as a dog whistle. )</p></li>
<li><p>After tax cuts, he had to quietly walk it back and raise revenues (vs bigger debt). And vs his retoric , he could embrace Gorbachov. He supported apartheit in S. Africa, Marcos and Contrats with weapon sales. “Freedom and democracy” justified everything.</p></li>
<li><p>pro-abortion as gov, but anti- as Prez, insisted VP Bush drop pro-abortion position when became running mate.</p></li>
<li><p>pro-immagration, but not for victims of Right Wing violance in L. America.</p></li>
<li><p>The New Right never accepted Reagan; saw religious zealots as opportunity to benefit from anger. Never pro-gay (supposedly he &amp; wife had too many Hollywood ties), but never fervently anti-gay (AIDS … just did nothing; did not rail against it)</p></li>
<li><p>Claim: by 1988, hard-right was not happy with Reagan (b/c he backed off lower taxes, deep budget cuts, he met with Gorbachov, did not push for anti-abortion Amend.) right wing had great expectations. Reagan was good politican, if proposal not popular he quicly backed off or blamed it on someone else.</p></li>
<li><p>So Bush, same policies as Reagan, became target of far-right, way to crtiicize Reaganism without criticizing Reagan.</p></li>
