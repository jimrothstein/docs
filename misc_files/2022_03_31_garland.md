Dear Hon Judge Garland:  


After hearing astonishing excerpts of  Judge David Carter's recent ruling
in the  John Eastman civil case, I read portions of his ruling for myself.

Though not a lawyer, I found his ruling relatively easy to follow.   But also quite
alarming:     an illegal attempt among dozens and dozens of high level
government officials and their professional advisers to grab power, an attempt to
overthrow the US government.

Masking this as some kind legal or political exercise is insulting.

Why are these people not being investigated and as appropriate prosecuted?
For what purpose does further delay serve?
