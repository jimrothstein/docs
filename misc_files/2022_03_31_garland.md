Dear Hon Judge Garland:  


After reading excerpts of  Judge David Carter's recent ruling
in the  John Eastman civil case, I urge you to investigate officials and
advisers in prior administration.

As a society, we must respond to public officials and their advisers who argue
they are immune to public scrutiny.   Clinging to dubious legal, political
and childish claims is insulting to Americans.

Moreover, the steady revelations from the House January 6th Committee leaves 
little doubt that dozens of high level government officials and their professional advisers sought to grab power, to to
overthrow the US government.

As a society, we must demand the entire truth.   We must respond in kind.

For what purpose does further delay serve?
