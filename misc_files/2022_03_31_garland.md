Dear Hon Judge Garland:  


After hearing excerpts of  Judge David Carter's recent ruling
in the  John Eastman civil case, I read portions of his ruling for myself.

Though not a lawyer, I found his ruling detailed, logically but still relatively easy to follow.  Together
with steady revelations from the House January 6th Committee, there seems
little doubt that dozens of high level government officials and their professional advisers sought to grab power, to to
overthrow the US government.

Masking their actions as some kind legitimate legal or political exercise is insulting.
Yet from reading Judge Carter's analysis, the professionals  most responsible now 
want to obscure their involvement behind childish excuses.


Why are these people not being investigated and prosecuted as appropriate?

The truth must be documented.  As a society we must respond to what happened.


For what purpose does further delay serve?
