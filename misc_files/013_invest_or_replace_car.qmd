## 2001 Honda Civic - 2 door 

168 K miles;

Mine:  last 11k miles, over 9 years (\~1200 miles per year)

**So per mile**, this is an expensive car (exclude gas, insurance ...):

Please consider:

1.  Timing Belt/gasket replacement?
2.  Driver seat belt (will not buckle)
3.  Passenger side headlight is out
4.  Driver side mirror (possible to tape?)
5.  Recent repairs (see records)
    1.  broken windshield (2024)
    2.  trunk latch (2023)
    3.  dashboard lights (especially speedometer)
    4.  broken steering (2022)
    5.  transmission (see records)
    6.  rear brake leak
	
6. (new) Slight sound or vibration, as if something wobbling or two parts touching. 

Can the car last to 200k another 10k?

**Better to maintain this one (cost, headaches, surprises) or use money for newer (\~2016 Honda)?**
