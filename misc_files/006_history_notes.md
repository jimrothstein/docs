## Russia
- Mongol vs Turkic vs Tatar?
-	populated long ago (~2000-3000 BC?) , possible Scandinavian offshoot?
-	859AD (Kiev) - 1st recorded writing (errors?)
-	Rus' = OLD EAST SLAV
-	1240-1480 AD Mongol invade.
-		-	Adopt Islam.
-		- Convert Tatar (Who, where, when?, from N. Central Asia)
- Ottoman (when)  depopulate Ukraine, as slaves brought to  Black Sea.
- Gives rise to Cossack's?   When Where?


## English Civil War
*  Gentry, landed Gentry:  upper class, but not nobles or church, inherited
    land, able to live by collecting rent.  Some actually wealthier  than
    nobles. 
\section{England - 17th}
1649 - Charles I beheaded (impeached)
1684 - James II (Catholic) succeeds brother Charles II.
1689 - William III (from Netherlands) removes James II .  **Glorious
Revolution** was actual neither.   Replaced one king with another - EXCEPT
King no longer sovereign but **constitutional monarch** meaning beholden to
English people(really?) and not elected by GOD.   **Whig** triumph (ie
aristocrats, oppose Catholic rule)

\section{Enlightenment}
Hobbes - man selfish interests, BUT capacity to REASON and realize collective
strength is the safest for all.   So Hobbes actually is pro-monarchy b/c
stability.
1616-1633 Gaelio battles Church.
Spinoza - Dutch Jew.  Independent path.
Locke  - man is individual. Different between richest and poorest is only
education, wealth ...   Babies start with blank slate.      life, freedom,
happiness .... unclear his view of property.   At one point, each should have
enough ... but elsewhere seemed to not rule out amassing property (then called
estates ?) and perhaps first capitalist - UNCLEAR.    Also tolerant (well,
maybe not for Catholics, jews)

## Impeach
England:  evolved as method for Parliament to assure power over King. (King
can not be prosecuted for any crime.)

## Whiskey Rebellion
Poor farmers refuse to pay whiskey tax that fed govt issues to raise money.
Some violence in and round Pittsburgh.  
Whiskey Rebellion  -   Washington eventually sent 13,000 troops  to supress
'western rebellion' and enforce the tax  colllection.     But the rebels
vanished into western PA  hills.    No further attempt was made to collect the
tax.  
Who cares? Federalist party and idea of stronger
central govt began to disappear . Until the Civil War, local and State's
rights ruled the day., 

## Alien and Sedition Acts - 1797 (Adams)
Unconstitutional, but based on perceived threat from French revolutionaries
and fellow-travelers to topple Federalist govt (Adams), was seldom used  but
left a taint to Federalist brand.   After Hamilton murder, Federalist were all
but gone.   (Federalist prefered England's stability to Jefferson's support
for anti-Monarchy French revolutionaries


## Pennsylvania RR
- (1852-1874) pres = J. Edgar Thompson, engineer, modernizes, uses Westinghouse Air Brake.
  -  (1877)  wage cut (Depression)
  -  (1889)  Johnstown Flood Disaster (just west Altoona Horse Shoe) PRR
      built; destroys PRR equipment/repair shops
## Religion in US
-	Darwin observed human species HELP preserve weakest;  not pure survival of
fitest.

- caution on FREE THINKERS, some anti-religion b/c of hatred of 'lower
		clases', ie very conservative.

- ditto for birth control b/c reduces children of 'unfit' classes.  Spencer
		prefers 'survival of fitest':  why waste money/reforms on lower classes.

Bryan - sounded like Fundamentalist.  Not quite.   His objection to
evolution:  IF man incapable of rising above lower animal instincts, then
SOCIAL REFORMS (ie done by us imperfect people) DOOMED to fail.  More modern
(?) social reforms necessary to CONTROL worst of human animal side.  ???

Scopes -  Though Bryan initially  won in court, the decision was actually
overturned on appeal (technical issue). Then appeals court closed  case,
without clear resolution on the main issue.  Should religious doctrine
(CREATION) be allowed in public school was never argued?

-	Reaction:  North saw victory (Bryan had looked out-of-touch); became less
vigilant. South:  rise of anti-evolution.  Backlash. What had not been much of
issue, became a southern cause.  


-	Ex:  1921 - Darwin on cover of Biology books.  1926 edition -he is gone.
	Evolution removed from southern textbooks.  LESSON:   do not put your
	teachers on trial, just change books.  True today!  Report (1936) Biology
	@1900 had more science than 1936.  Creation remained LAW in many states;
	Texas much of 20C and certainly after 1980s.

  *  **J. Howard Pew** (Sun Oil) capitalism and religion do NOT conflict.  Use of
      religion in conservatism. Prior mostly just rich, anti-New Deal, or
      ideology (Ann Ryan, a few university profs). Pew wants return to
      fundamentalism.  Opposes Niebuhr and liberal Christian ideology.

      **Billy Graham** (1955)

/section{Ludendorff}
-   6/14/1914 -assassination
-   Schlieffen Plan - Paris in 4 weeks; then Russia in 4 months;  Route through
Belgium,  not directly from Alasce into France b/c too well fortified.  But
Belgium resists more than expected.   Gen Ludendorff uses new gun and breaks
through.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlieffen_Plan
-   But Russians move too soon.   DUO of Ludendorff and older, aristocrat
Hindenberg defeat Russians by analyzing the two Russian armies and defeat
them. **Battle of Tannenberg**   However, what appeared as military success
violates Schlieffen Plan.    Germany faces  **TWO FRONT WAR**  Argument
Germany could have sued for peace and everyone could have gone home.
-   **Rathenau** Jewish industrialist; brilliant planner; and keeps Germany
economy afloat.    Not why did the war take 4 years, but how did Germany
survive for 4 years.
-   East or West, Kaiser dithers between 1914 and 1916 while military asks him
    to choose which one first.  Falkkenhayn (military leader in charge) says
    East; Ludendorff says West.
-   Faced with no choose,  Falkkenhayn devises Verdun Plan, control area
    around Verdun and bleed the city dry.  Falekkenhayn[^1] is realist and able
    general, but this is a Military failure;  almost equal deaths; pointless
    as French General activates superhuman logistics effort.  Falkkenhayn now
    replaced with Ludendorff.  Post Verdun Ludendorff + Hidenberg as figure
    head in control.  Will control army + govt as effective military
    dictatorship. :    
    :[^1] FALK also sought political way to end war; Russia was not favorable
    and German diplomats not eager;  another failure.
-   Turnip Winter (1916-17)

## Rise of Hard Right:  anti_New Deal.
  *  hate National Recovery Act's price controls; profanity to business.
  *  Assorted groups in 1930s-1950s, Leonard Read (Chamber of Commerce, vast
      networking, Foundation for Econ Education) Liberty League (duPonts)
      National Association of Manuf.  These are not nice people; have agenda.
      Barody (American Enterprise):  soft touch, `policy papers` to give to
      Congress.  Others:  Eventually pursue mass audience, get mass recruits
      (not just business or ideology or religious)
  *  By 1978, Powell memo; Kenysian not working; corp MUST get into poltics.
      First use of PAC. Coors.   Prop 13 (Laffer had hand?  cut taxes, watch
      GDP soar).  Heritage Found (Coors).  Jack Kemp:  stop regulating, cut
      cut cut; GDP will be unleashed. 
  *  More post-Powell:   Business Round table (soft touch, CEOS only; direct
      reach to pols, both D and R;  and Carter, NO social issues, Softer touch
      but same as Bouleware or Goldwater)  Chamber of Commerce (not big biz;
      "entrapenues",   Amyway - DEVOS - "American Way".   Anyone can join C of
      C. more aggressive, freedom and capitalism; populist; more like political
      party than lobbyist)

## Ayn Rand, novels, 1943-1957.
  *  "common good" is awful |  self-interest paramount |  it is better moral
      code than even religion (?!)
  * property:  absolute right to do what you want w/ property.  No govt
      interference  Business loves her.

## Sen Taft, isolationist
1938 - New Deal stirs hatred of rich | will bring socialism; isolationist.


##  Unconditional - notes from book; Japanese surrender.
  * Work with japanese 'moderates':  US Amb toJapan in 1920s, "Jap" experts: 
       Grew and Dooman (but 1920s Japanese rulers very different  from
       militarists) ; Hoover (!) - Stimpson Doctrine, based on observations of
       1st round of Japanese aggression, 1931: moderates will soon prevail.
       FDR had provoked Japan??
  * Russia Hawks, GOP & Hoover, Russia will dominate a weak China; must
      negotiate with Japan asap before Russia enters war against Jap. Russia
      is now bigger fear.  On other hand, as against Hitler, let Russia take
      the caualties to fight Japan.
  * Other US factors:  US pop is war weary;  GOP pillared Wilson for pursuing
      14th points rather than unconditional German surrender.   Iwo
      Jima/Okinawa (April - June 22, 1945): ferocious Jap fighting. 1942
      elections:  Dem lose 45 in H, 9 in Senate: New Deal in retreat.
  *  Marshall (Army Chief of Staff) `thinker`:  invasion necessary for Jap
      surrender.   Stimson (War), Know (Navy)
  *  Japanese:  Togo (Foregin Minister): end war NOW, but all other seek
      a battle victory before negotiating.  Military (fight, fight till win):
      plan to mobilize entire nation, including suicides.  Generally, Japanese
      feel time on their side,  attrition hurts US more than Jap; buys time.
  *  June 8, 1945.  Susuki, now head of state, reaffirms fight, not negotiate.
  *  Then Kido (head of govt) plan (doomed) withdraw from former EU colonies, 
        ask Russia to mediate; this is "daring" attempt to modify Jap Army
        plan. didn't happen.
  *  June 18, 1945  consent for delegation to Moscow, but Jap Army/Navy may
      contact Russia  ONLY after Japanese battle victory.
  *  Hirhito




## US, WWII VP Wallace, Am style facism.
- 1944?   "build a wall around the US so high and so secure that not a single
		alien or foreign refugee from any country ... could possibly scale or
		ascend it."   Senator Reynolds (D-NC, Military Affairs Committee,
		isolationist, racist, wealthy; "Fortess American")

- Henry Wallace,  April 9, 1944: 
-
- "The American fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate
- perversion of truth and fact.   Their newspapers and propaganda
		carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity, every crack in the common
		front against fascism. They use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their
		own selfish imperialism.  They cultivate hate of and distrust of both
		Britain and Russia.  They claim to be super-patriots, but they would
		destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution.  They demand free
		enterprise but their spokesman for monopoly and vested interests.   Their
		final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture
		political power so that, using power of the state and the power of the
		market simultaneously, they may keep the common man in eternal subjection.


##  GE Strike, Boulware
-   1946 strikes catches GE off guard (huh?).   Emerges Boulware:  GE is boss,
    not union.  You take what we give; no matter how long you strike.

##	HUAC
-	claim:  there really was effort by CPUSA and "popular front" to disseminate
organizing, education, labor activities.  But overthrow?? 
-	1947, 1948 (?) investigates communist influence in Hollywood (actors,
directors, writers ...)  Vicious.   Many those targeted had liberal leanings or
depicted another side of life in their works, films  themes like religious
tolerance, anti-Semitic (ex:  John Wayne film
ALSO shows heroism of fighters in Burma?)   HUAC forced you to take
stand or they would end your career.  Some, including an RKO executive Dore
Schary , stood their ground ("Until the time is proven that a Communist is dedicated to
overthrow gov't,  I can not determine any grounds for hiring but the man's
competance.

##  William F Buckley emerges:
  *  pro-McCarthy
  *  anti-'elite' liberal education
  *  labor union "monopolies"
  *  he seeks non-business adherents to conversative (more ideological)


##  John Birch Society, real person
-   1939 rural Georgia, bible-thumping family, graduates college.
-   1940 July Shanghai China as missionary
-   1942 by how fluent in Chinese, saving souls, he works among Chinese;
meets Doolittle. (APR).   In July '42 Flying Tigers (volunteers) now called
"US-China Air Task Force" (Chennault) and in '43 becomes 14th Air Force.  To
survive, Birch joins US army in China.
-   1943 Birch in Chansgha, behind Japanese lines provides intelligence re:
Jap troops, status of airfields.
-   1944 (July) Chennault awards Birch metals for his work.  Birch seems to excel at
everything he does. (Oct) Vinegar Joe is out. Gen Wedemeyer in (too
sympathetic to CCK)
-   1945 (late August) war over.   Birch and party stopped by Communists (not
something unusual or alarming).  But Birch is tired, weary from war ... makes
threatening move and is killed.  A tragety , but not a hero. his fault.
-   AFTERMATH:  Wedemeyer talks down to Mao, bad move.   Mao protests had
saved dozens of American pilots, knew nothing about his indicident.   Beside
you are operating in our country, area controlled by us, why didn't you inform
us of operations?   Later testimony, Birch did provoke.  Birch knew Chinese
well-enough not to act this way.    Later, US army does
NOT award medals, not a hero, US & China were on **same side**    Zhu-de does
investigate writes report.   Mao does take incident seriously, but facts point
to Birch's own error.    US Wedmeyer and Ambass Hurley ... choose CKK.
Americans just too arogant.    **US-China cooperation effectively begins to end.**

-   Sen Knowland, anti-communist since at least 1946, makes speech in 1950.
Birch's mother endlessly lobbies.    First American death of next war?   Just
spirals on and on.   Welch, of Sugar Dadddy, Junior Mints, Pom-poms,  looks
for symbol.   Welch part of well funded effort..... 

-   1952 Taft also sees communistis everywhere.  But Eisenhower gets
nomination.   Birch Society forms actively in 1957? 1958?



## IKE and presidental power
John Foster Dulles dies in June 1959;  thaw begins in East-West. Major
conference set for 1960, Paris.    Failed. 
IKE  even was tiring of Nixon's  infatuation  with seeing REDS everywhere.
NO.  The event was U-2 shot down.  
Message by You: IKE *seemed* to have some
decent instincts. But he also tolerate or set the stage for all kinds of bad
shit., Saturday, December 12 2020, 12:33 PM IKE *seemed* to have some decent
instincts.      But he also tolerate or set the stage for all kinds of bad
shit.  

One legacy: creeping Presidental power to make war. He
got Senate approval for various forgotten incidents in Taiwan, Lebanon that
would allow future presidents to have all kinds of undeclared wars., Saturday,


Adlai Steveson: After Senate passed one of these 85-3,
Congress has given president a "blank check".,

## Goldwater:  1957 hearings.
Hates unions, "freedeom", no one should challenge the boss.   Walter Ruether
at hearings.

##  JFK
  -  To balance conscience and job, he promised to resign if ever conflict!
-	Both JFK and esp HHH supported clause  allow govt to arrest/detain
subversives in times of national crisis.   1962 Cuban Missile,  FBI Hoover
kept list and called many such subversives (anonymously, to track them). JFK
did not declare emergency.  Bernstein's parents of (Berstein/Woodruff)
receieved phone calls.

## SCOTUS
    - Did you know this ???     From SCOTUS oral arugment ....   "political
  promises"    are not contracts, not enforceable,  not legal justification to
  replace the politician!

##  Mon  14 Dec 2020  50 years from now, today will be remembered as ....
 - Day USA passed 300K covid deaths
 - Day USA began vaccinations
 - Day AG William Barr resigned
 - Day Electoral College voted Biden President.
 - Day American people began to realize EC must be replaced.
 - Day American people began to realize Constitution out-of-date.
 - Day American people began to realize how much damage Trump had done to
     USA.
 - Day American people began to realize USA is in decline.
 - Known for some other reason.
 - Long forgotten day.



##	Lorraine Hansberry (Rasisen in the Sun)
-	1930s, raised in area south/west of Washington Park (between Cottage and
Grand (MLK))
-	some areas black, some white .... Woodlawn all white.
-	father chopped up apts to make room for steady flow of north-bound black
migrants.  Made him rich.  but ran into racial covenants.  Sued.  (He is the
new LANDLORD as bldg change owners).  Very ambiguous to me:  what were racial/economic boundaries?
-	attends public schools; mixed white;  Lorraine is cursed, spit upon, etc
for father's suit against covenants.
-	2 older sisters attend Howard U; `popular` rich young black women; arrive
with multiple trunks in toe.
-	not so, Lorraine; attends U Wisc; scholarship;  contends with
	implicit/explicit racism; blossoms into rebel but endears all who come
	within in her reach.  eventually Communist.
