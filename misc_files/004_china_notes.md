Questions
* Mao's Compromises to (a) get power <1949 (b) unify state >1949
* Who was Walter (Henry?) Judd, missionary in 1930s, tried to warn US of Japan
* Why didn’t China industrialize? Many theories 
* luck (England had coal) ?
   * Decreased Church power in West (enlightenment, reformation, rise of Protestant & work of individual)?
   * China - relative stablility, whole; which led to inward thinking (ex: cancel Naval exploraton)
   * Europe - 500 warring states, forced nobles to be more open to technology?
   * China - Confucism - inward, passive?

   * Did China peak too early?
   * had technology, gov't (Confucian burearacy), relative wealth & stability
   * but by 18thC corrupt, aging, overpopulated  ==> foreigners can dominate (humiliating to China) 
   *            


Timeline


2C-3C (BC) Hsiung-nu (on eastern steppe)
~1000 (BC) - Duke of Zhou - led a virtuous life
Confucious (~200 BC) - lived in Warring States, wished for order, thought past better: admired Duke of Zhou and presumed morality.  Education (to study virtuous past), Ritual (physcial act to admire past purer times), Relationships (superior - inferior).   C- would become more accepted only later.
vs. Daoism  - more egalitarian and prized spontaneity over ritual.  Ying-yang order of universe
vs. Legalism - rulers need respect (feared if necessary), not simply admired as C- .   So harsh punishment is ok.
Constantinople (4th Century , “New Rome”) created; manage eastern Rome Empire
Rome Falls (5C)
6C-7C AD  Turks Empire - on steppe
8C-840 After Turks fall, Uighur Turks settle in Tarim basin, peaceful; Mongolians adopt Uighur script for written language
1030s Turks, successful military tribe from steppe east of Caspian, adopt Islam; become dominant force Baghdad Caliphate, as latter declines; continue attacks in Asia Minor, eventually threaten Byzantine Empire itself (~1090s).  Turks quick moving horses.
1054 Catholic and Orthodox Church split
1066 Norman conquest of Anglo-Saxon England
1095 Pope Urban II, call to retake Jeruselum, First Crusade begins.   One theory, not nearly as motivating, is that Byzantium actually in military & civil crisis.   Emporer Alexios implored Pope for help.
1099 Sack of  Jeruselum
10C Liao Dynasty - Khitans (from north) conquer north China (i.e. Suzhou north to Peking - plains) (barbarians! - clever Chinese allow dynasty, but keep their own ciivilization)
1043-45AD - "Minor Reforms" can there be "loyal opposition" in China? - failed
1120 Chin ('golden') Dynasty - Jurchen (related to Manchus) replace Khitans (who settle settle west in Central Asia (x-USSR republics?) But Juritans more interested in China, leaving power vaccum in Mongolia. [Mongols can consider China as trade partners or as plunder]
Qara-Khitai empire religious tolerant, good admin.   Claim: Mongols would benefit from Khitians from joining Mongol empire.
~1500 - East|West about same standard of living, why did Industrial Revolution take hold in West?
-1403-1425 Adm Zheng He’s travels, but ‘scholars’ are conservative (look inward, social order ) vs. eunuchs (corrupt, money, trade)
-Portugal went to Asia; but Asia didn’t go to Portugal (though they could have)
1588 - English defeat Spanish Armada
16th C - Shanghai builds wall to keep out Japanese pirates (south of what is now Bund)
-Nomadic tribes in Central Asia (“Stans”) decrease as Russian and Chinese empire expand.  (Bolsheviks ‘inherit’ moslem states. Today, “Stans”  ~30MM ppl, mostly Moslem, poor, ruled by dictators)


18th C - outgrows wall
1796-1804 - White Lotus Rebellion  Ex. of Han religous rebellion to overthrow Qing (i.e. Manchu) and retore Ming (began as economic, flood).  Supressed, but at a big cost, and further weakened Qing, with Opium Wars about to start.

1840s
6/19/1842 - British in Shanghai; French want their own section
8/29/1842 - Treaty of Nanking
Canton vs. Shanghai:
foreigners live in ghetto - open city
foreigners bring chinese compradors from Canton to Shanghai
‘40s?  - Warren Delano, father of Sara,  becomes HK opium trader and builds fortune 
1851 - Taiping (also anti-Confucious)
1853 - Taiping make Nanjing as capitol
1853 - Secret society seizes Chinese city in Shanghai
1858-1860 - various treaties;  including ceding much of NE China (beyond Amur
River) to Russia.  see Treaty of Aigun.     ARea around Lake Baikal,
always Russian?  see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Nerchinsk (1689)
1859 - riots in Amoy/Canton (Shanghai?) - first rise of hatred toward foreigners (reason?)
1860s - As Taiping threaten Shanghai:
British/foreigner huge profits (1) real estate bubble; exorbidiant rents to Chinese refuges, some very wealthy (2) gunning run (3) 'protecting' rich Suzhou merchants fleeing to Shanghai; French don't allow abuse & speculation as British; Int'l Settlement grows haphazardly, densely as waves of refuges arrive
1860 - Treaty of Tientsin (ends 2nd Opium War) - interior opened to trade & westerners
1864 - Taiping suppressed (?), but Shanghai has acquired image of adventure, profits, frontier - contrasting stuffy England - attracting all sorts of foreigners
Lots of money to made. real estate profits now go to  cotton speculation/export  (US civil war); lavish lifestyles 
Rise of opium, coolies, forced labor, corruption (esp. ports), bubbles
-steamboat arrives; interior open by Treaty of T; Shanghai major opium port; opium taxed so 'legal' (i.e. warehouses, logistics!)
-end of slavery, Chinese transported to New World, large profits for foreigners - no prosecution.
Extraterritorial (foreigners ruled by their own laws, not Chinese laws); separate police, laws in each foreign zone
-bubbles in cotton/tea/real estate markets - crash every 2-3 decades
1865 - HSBC formed - growing JV foreign money & rich Chinese (fled Taiping)
-Rise of Chinese investments in shipping/factories, but Empress (after 1860 death of Emperor) jealous, restrains private econcomy ( unlike Japan, which encourages)


1880s - missionaries arrive, esp. US, find big cities, esp. tolerant shanghai, appalling
1890s - Chinese grow opium in south, SW china, with gov't support (now opium legal) - bring to Shanghai by Yangtze steamship; attempt to break British lock on business - FAILS; but British start to leave business (Jardine firm quits) - for (1) more genteel businesses [GB forced to end opium by 1917] (2) opium falling under Sephardic and Farsi controlin Shanghai (control it by 1870).  Rise of Sassoons (from Bagdad, other Iraqi Jews) - opium, cotton, real estate.
1894-5 - First Sino-Japanese war; China's loss is Shanghai's gain - By Treaty of Shimonoseki (17APR1905) Japanese (and therefore all foreigners in treaty port law) can open factories; investments in Shanghai increase.   (Defeat, humiliation - chinese see need to change); 
-fought over Korea (a long-term vassal state to China,  but waning;  rising Japanese), declared  independent; Japan wanted to Korea’s ‘protectorate’  Japan awarded Taiwan & Manchuria, including Liaodong Peninsula 
23APR1905 - Quickly, Russia arranges “Triple Intervention” and Japan accepts addn Chinese reparations and leaves Manchuria/Liaodong alone (Jap right-wing angry)
1898-1905 - Russia signs 25-lease with Qing on Liaodong, develops Dal’ni with Russian architects, layout, “Paris of the East”, Nicholas II, Port Arthur=Russian Navy Port, Russia eyes rest of Manchuria & Korea




Boxer Rebellion (anti-Christian, anti-foreigner and actually pro-Qing; superstitious; cause: drought) name comes from British who thought martial arts were boxing
-Beijing too traditional; Empress supports Boxers - but backfires - must use western troops to crush; Empress needs foreign loans, signs Boxer Protocol west controlling Chinese government finances, Great Brit saves Qing, but humiliating to Qing


Foreign Community hold out for 55 days siege by anti-westerner Boxers, together with some court intreqe.  Western armies arrive to end siege.
Shanghai - attracts western-trained Chinese, press.  
In Manchuria, by 1900, Boxers destroy ⅔ Dalian-Harbin RR. Russia sends troops to protect RR and its nationals.  Despite 1901, Boxer Protocols Russia keeps troops to Korean border (eyeing Korea?), ignoring the Protocol.   Japan, as ‘protectorate’ of Korea from 1895 Sino-Jap War, can’t ignore Russian presence.  Russia estimates Trans-Siberian RR will arrive Dalian by 1904, so Japan knows it must act sooner[1]


1905 - Treaty of Portsmouth (NH, US  T. Roosevelt) Liaoning to Japan; rest of Manchuria to China (again Japanese right-wing annoyed); Korea to Japan; S. Manchurian RR to Japan; I assume this is beginning of Japanese in Dalian.   
Why US & Roosevelt?   Claim:  Japan saw Russian bear, including trans-Siberian RR, heading toward Manchuria and Korea, potentially boxing Japan in.    Japan thinks “friendly” neutral country will aid at bargaining table, post-conflict. Harvard educated Japanese knows TR, who agrees.  TR wins Noble Prize!  Ignores Japanese aggression in Korea.
-1904 - Russia’s Far East Fleet attacked and blocked
-1905 - Russia’ Port Arthur siege (bitter land battle) falls to Japan 2Jan1905 ; trans-Siberia RR supplied Port Arthur; other land battles in Mukden(spring 1905)
-1905 - Russia’s Baltic Fleet (sent from Europe) and nearly destroyed between Japan and Korea on way to Vlavosd (Battle of Tsushima - May 1905)




1911 - revolution - bloodless & fizzles (uprising in several cities); Shanghai separates from Qing Nov 3-4, 1911 - men cut off pigtails
-Chen Chi-mei (hero of Shanghai 1911 revolution - murdered 1916); young military officer Chiang Kai-shek (CKS)
1912-1916
-Sun soon flees to Japan, yields to  Yuan Shi-Kai  (warlord, x-Qing official/general, who has an army) govt is too strong, rules to 1916
-rise of gangs, thugs, beginning of endless factions, power struggles etc. to 1926


WWI - Shanghai industrializes (westerners go to war, Chinese-owned factories to handle domestic demand and expand)
Pootung
	warehouses
	Chapei
	west of Hongkew - north of Suzhou Creek - large industrial base

New Culture Movement (1915-1923) - anti Confuscious
May 4 Movement - arises from student/intellectual Tianamin rally (1919) to protest Treaty of Versailles, sell-out to Japan (Shandong); a movement, future leaders arise from here; June, 1919 Shanghai general strike;


Mao  and mentor: Chen Duxiu
Lu Xun , aka Zhou Shu ren - writer, essays, sets tone for anti-Confucious movements of early 20th C; not Party member, but idolized; wrote of oppression of women; need to use bai hua (“plain speech” by govt officials - not classical Chinese); to understand Party discussions need to understand words of Lu Xun (~ “Big Brother”, “1984” in western lit)
Li Dazhao (wrote of Russian Revolution)
Zhou Enlai and wife Deng Yinghcao


1922 - 27
KMT, CCP (First United Front)  - with players from USSR
1926

Northern Expedition (1926 -  1927)
Nationalists + Communists, under CKS,  end of warlords
Shanghai - 1927 (C- great at organizing)
Nanjing (now capital), and eventually (without C-):
BeiPing (“Northern Peace) - 1928


4/12/1927 - end of cooperation, KMT massacres CCP (Shanghai),


1928
-June (Moscow) - 6th CCP Party Congress




1927-1933
-difficult for CCP
-3 MM people in Shanghai (1/130 is prostute?); 2x (1895-1910) and then 3x (1910-1930)


1930s
-- US:   ‘China Lobby’ promulgates Chiang Kai Shek, as US friend who lead to a Christian China.   Seeks boycott of oil to Japan.  Japan has 2 sources of oil:   California & Indonesia.  But FDR disagrees: feels will force Japan to menace Indonesia (correct!) and this will eventually draw in USA in an asian war.
   
FDR’s original strategy is Europe 1st, defeat Hitler; defeat Japan only if necessary.
Claim:  War with Japan could have been avoided; result instead led to “Who Lost China?” and this affected US policy from Korea, to Vietnam and beyond.
Claim:  FDR reminded people his family knew something about China, even though this “knowledge” was terribly outdated and from the perspective of an opium trader trying to pry open a China that did not want foreigners on their soil, let alone learn its culture.  FDR’s source of wealth (opium) rarely discussed or well-known.


1945
-7th CCP Party Congress (Yan'an)
==================


1946 -- Nixon and McCarthy 1st elected to House
===================


===================
1948 - Deng Xiao Ping (DXP), consolidating SW China (Chengdu-CQ railroad?)


Fall 1948 - Madame Chiang arrives, seeks aid from Truman (ambivilant) ; then leads lobby efforts based in Riverdale, NY.   Various strands would eventually come together:  wealthy donors, Republican hawks, Walter Judd (R? - Minn; had lived in China), Chennault, over-the-Hump, who wants CIA involvment. 


Nov 1948 - Truman defeats Dewey,  - Defense: Louis Johnson (Hawk) to replace James Forrestal (HAWK, hard-line anti Communist; also sought racial integration of US army; opposed Truman wind-down US defense spending) ; State: Dean Acheson  to replace ailing Marshall.   Kennan less concerned with Soviet military power (than Acheson), but with its political influence in world, so urged containment and not beneath supporting Spain’s Franco as buffer or efforts to cause splits in western leftist parties  (journalist Walter Lippman urges US leave Europe and stop interfering)


Truman’s beliefs -- Chiang too corrupt, inept to support; but distrust of Mao; ie no good options “wait and see”   Belief that Chinese people will eventually reject Mao.   At one point, wants independent China to be one pillar of stable world (along with US/Britain/USSR).    Vs Europe where Soviet occupation of eastern Europe; Berlin airlift.  anti-Communist at core, ie always need to take “hard-line”  Truman Doctrine , US will step in as Britian withdraws to keep peoples free (or some such thing).   Triggered by Britian leaving Greece, Turkey. 
==================
1949  
-life expectancy - 35
-Tianamenn Square built >1949 (tear down buildings)




April 1949  -- Mao troops amass around Shanghai


May 1949 -- George Kennan (State) recommends explain ‘wait and see’ to US public.   State works on “China White Paper”
May 25 1949 -- Troops enter Shanghai, scattered resistance, esp near BUND (or defensive to enable Nationalist to flee?);  May 27 over.   However, Mao concerned may be western (US) invasion.
“Zhou Demarche” - now believed diversion; Mao attempt to delay any western invasion: claim Party spit, some to seek aid from Moscow, other seek aid from US/Britain for Chinese redevelopment.  But Truman takes as signal he was right about “wait and see” policy, that Chinese people 


June 1949 --  Trial of Alger Hiss (x-State and Acheson friend) passing info to Soviet; accused by reporter Whittaker Chambers, says they worked together.  (Chambers becomes fierce anti-Communist.)   Whipping up anti-Communist voices.   HUAC “out-of-control” (Truman in 1948 speech; but also issues his own loyalty orders, to quiet his own critics?)   “Heat” increases on Truman’s China Policy.   Truman 


CIA spying/counter-intelligence - shortwave, Shenyang consulate (falls late ‘48), hiring Japanese agents … Did Moscow exaggerate this (to split US-China)?  Did Mao exaggerate?


-- Stuart - US Ambass to China, old-China hand, believes China & US share some kind of bond; thinks things can be worked out.  (never really got the chance?)   miscues between Mao, US?  (since no direct contact)


-- China Lobby, Madame Chiang (in NY) and Ambass Woo reconsile petty differences; united front to change US public, effort to divide China (Mao) -US;    Chiang bombs Chinese ports, blockades mainland, cut cables (real ass-hole).   Acheson does not criticize (miscue to Mao?) and just reluctant to get involved.   Truman tells Koo we can win in south/east China.   Truman “show me”, tired of years of promises and beginning of BREAK with Chiang.


-- But Congress, quizzing Acheson, why no aid?  Telling Judd and Congress truth doesn’t seem to work; increasing pressure on Acheson.


-- Chiang now urging wife (in US) to go public, get US public’s sympathy.    Mao of course does not know details but suspects US-Chiang conspiracy.


CLAIM:  Historically, China’s center holds when China’s periphery is subdued, such as Xianggang and islands in EAST. Mao supports Ho Chi Min.     Stalin urges China fight Moslems in West China and populate with Han!!  Stalin fears UK will try to stir things up.


Stalin -- promises Mao low-cost loans, military help, build navy, use of Soviet sailors!


Late June -- Mao speech, denounces West, US and imperialism.   This ends hope of US-China dialog.   Ambass Stuart, leaves.


MacArthur, in Japan, need for Christianity and democracy in Asia.   (What happened to Wilson’s self-determination?)


July 1949 --








WWII - Jewish Ghetto (Shanghai, Intl Quarter) - >20,000 - only place where no visa required; open Shanghai?
October 1, 1949 - CPR Founded

1978
-12/18/78 - 3rd Plenum of 11th CCP Central Committee - Begin “Reform Era”
(soon large collectives broken up; farm productivity increases; SOE subsidies cut)
Deng, as pramatist, wanted results and studied other Asian Tiger success (Mao just dictated -no need to look at data)

China protests at Taiwan arm sales.  This delays US-Sino military cooperation
-By 1982, US pipes down support for Taiwan, finally China ready to buy US guidance system, but ….
-By mid-1980s, Gorbachav | glasnost.   China sees less reason to buy US arms.   Claim: 1969-1989 was lost oppty for US & China to be aligned militarily.

Lucy's Grandfather (brother of her mother's father?) - had very firm handshake - a grip -  at age 82 (2005); not a big guy; but clearly healthy, strong, alert;  had walked from Shandong Province to Dalian in 1939 (brother here?; why? hunger in Shandong?).  Lucy & I later saw a picture of old Dalian - a man pulling a rickshaw - "That's what my grandfather did."   He had a stroke shortly after I met and I regretted not being able to talk with him again.   He and his wife (blind) lived on top floor of apartment building (near far side of Liaoning Normal University); must be terrible to age in China.  As is customary, Lucy would only say he's not doing well with no details.  I still feel bad.
