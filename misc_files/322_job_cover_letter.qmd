I seek a position that is primarily R coding and the related problem solving.

I bring stability, curiousity and the willingness to be informal mentor to
younger coders.

You will notice a gap in my resume for the years I lived in China, a rich,
broaden experience.  While in China, I did teach an introductory java course
and later set and managed a popular website/forum for both Chinese and
foreigners in and around Dalian, China.

Since returning to the US, I have focused on the R package and related tools,
such as neovim, github, linux command line etc.

Prior to China, I did a number of database projects using the Paradox
database, some mySQL and MS Access.  These included a law firm conflict
database; a multi-table asset database for large real estate firm (aggregating
assets from joint ventures and their individual properties).

At this point, I wish to focus on R and technical issues.

Thank you.
