Dear Paula:

I am from ancient history.

Long ago your parents knew my parents and grandparents (especially
Ethel), probably from battles decades earlier.    If you have limited
recollection if any at all,  I would not surprised.

In the very early 60s (JFK?), I think they had some kind of arrangement with a
beach bungalow in Rockaway.  That is my first recollection of you and Danny,
though there were probably earlier connections.  Cliff, my younger brother was
maybe 2 or 3.  We were all just little kids.    Paths crossed again late 60s
(Nixon?).  At my grandmother's apt (Linden Blvd, in East NY) I remember your
father exclaiming how he liked her (oily) kasha knishes.  I visited your home
once, where I heard WBAI for the first time.  (Maybe it was all just one day.) 


I remember I was carrying a  politics book that not everyone would approve.
With the slightest wink, my mother (Louise) assured me "You can show it to
them".  Indeed, Danny dove right in.


That's it.  

I did a google search for Danny the other day and glad to found out he had
prospered but saddened .  On our end, only my brother and I are still around.

As to me, some people figure things out, but I am one who never did, though I am ok. 

Once again you may not remember me at all;  especially  since I was afraid
of young girls then and it is entirely possible we exchanged barely a word.
More likely you might remember my parents/grandparents. 

We live in completely different world now.   I thought I would say 'hello.'
