## Russia
- Mongol vs Turkic vs Tatar?
-	populated long ago (~2000-3000 BC?) , possible Scandinavian offshoot?
-	859AD (Kiev) - 1st recorded writing (errors?)
-	Rus' = OLD EAST SLAV
-	1240-1480 AD Mongol invade.
-		-	Adopt Islam.
-		- Convert Tatar (Who, where, when?, from N. Central Asia)

Peter the Great (1689 - 1725) kicks out Swedes, makes St. Peter's capital.
Academy (1724), esp for math, attracts Euler, Bernoulli.

1730 - 1745, turmoil, trials, executions, till Catherine the Great, Euler
returns.
(Berlin Academy - Fred the Great, ego but not so great, after 7 years war: famine)

- Ottoman (when)  depopulate Ukraine, as slaves brought to  Black Sea.
- Gives rise to Cossack's?   When Where?
- ~1852 Russia expansionary; considers itself true defenders of religion; in
Holy Land, Russians considered pious visitors, but French are merely
'tourists'.   Russia eyes Ottman, while Fr & UK, despite own suspicions of
each other, prop up Ottoman to block Russians.

Great Terror - show-trials, Bukharin, Lev Kamenev, Zinoviev,  Alexi Rykov, but Pasternak
(born 1890) asks why spared?     


\section{Ottoman}
-   330  Constantine establishes Eastern outpost.
-   1054 Rome excommunicates East.
-   late 11th  end Crusades; Christians hold HolyLand.
-   1204 Constantinople - sacked by western crusaders; tension between 2
Christianities. 
-   1405 Ottoman seize Constantinople - but very tolerant.  Russia
increasingly orthodox.
-   15-19th Both France and Russia have claims `spiritual` and protector ties
    to Holy land.  Monks, some also not so pious, do all the work in Holy
    Land.
-   1852 SPARK. Unruly pilgrims, not so pious...   Nicholas I extends
protection.  Napolean III (?) seeking support of Fr Catholics also steps in;
French warships to Holy Land.  Now UK is nervous.


## English Civil War
*  Gentry, landed Gentry:  upper class, but not nobles or church, inherited
    land, able to live by collecting rent.  Some actually wealthier  than
    nobles. 
\section{England - 17th}
1649 - Charles I beheaded (impeached)
1684 - James II (Catholic) succeeds brother Charles II.
1689 - William III (from Netherlands) removes James II .  **Glorious
Revolution** was actual neither.   Replaced one king with another - EXCEPT
King no longer sovereign but **constitutional monarch** meaning beholden to
English people(really?) and not elected by GOD.   **Whig** triumph (ie
aristocrats, oppose Catholic rule)

\section{Enlightenment}
Hobbes - man selfish interests, BUT capacity to REASON and realize collective
strength is the safest for all.   So Hobbes actually is pro-monarchy b/c
stability.
1616-1633 Gaelio battles Church.
Spinoza - Dutch Jew.  Independent path.
Locke  - man is individual. Different between richest and poorest is only
education, wealth ...   Babies start with blank slate.      life, freedom,
happiness .... unclear his view of property.   At one point, each should have
enough ... but elsewhere seemed to not rule out amassing property (then called
estates ?) and perhaps first capitalist - UNCLEAR.    Also tolerant (well,
maybe not for Catholics, jews)

## Impeach
England:  evolved as method for Parliament to assure power over King. (King
can not be prosecuted for any crime.)

## Whiskey Rebellion
Poor farmers refuse to pay whiskey tax that fed govt issues to raise money.
Some violence in and round Pittsburgh.  
Whiskey Rebellion  -   Washington eventually sent 13,000 troops  to supress
'western rebellion' and enforce the tax  colllection.     But the rebels
vanished into western PA  hills.    No further attempt was made to collect the
tax.  
Who cares? Federalist party and idea of stronger
central govt began to disappear . Until the Civil War, local and State's
rights ruled the day., 

## Alien and Sedition Acts - 1797 (Adams)
Unconstitutional, but based on perceived threat from French revolutionaries
and fellow-travelers to topple Federalist govt (Adams), was seldom used  but
left a taint to Federalist brand.   After Hamilton murder, Federalist were all
but gone.   (Federalist prefered England's stability to Jefferson's support
for anti-Monarchy French revolutionaries

\section{ After Napoleon}
-   removes many parochial, arthritic European structures like local tariffs,
reduces number of German municipalities, etc.   setting environment `more
friendly` to industrial revolution.
-   France, Germany, USA ... also contributed to technological improvements,
not just England.  Empirical fact(?):  more capital per worker, more GDP per
worker. Why is Peru `poor`, cheaper to use 19th C inventions b/c cheap labor,
its GDP/Capital is about where England was in 19th.

##  Panic 1837 (1837-1848)
-   after period of rapid growth, esp. land.
-   by 1837, deep depression; one of worst in US history. 
-   US is dominated by England, for capital, for markets (cotton), and for
imports.
-   Several states default (not US govt) and state govt debt is **sovereign**,
can not sue for it in its own state court.
-   English bankers get pissed at defaults:   see what happens in democracy;
lose all values of  paying one's debts.  If US cotton crop fails, English
factories layoff -> English recession and then of course no demand for US
cotton the next year. Very tight ties bet US and London bankers.
-   Lessons?  Without hegemony, US or any country can not separate its
domestic and foregin policies.  Longer term changes, US States get out of
capital improvement projects (ie less public bonds, let private section do
this), States begin to deploy
property tax to raise revenues (and less sales of land) 
## Pennsylvania RR
- (1852-1874) pres = J. Edgar Thompson, engineer, modernizes, uses Westinghouse Air Brake.
  -  (1877)  wage cut (Depression)
  -  (1889)  Johnstown Flood Disaster (just west Altoona Horse Shoe) PRR
      built; destroys PRR equipment/repair shops
## Religion in US
-	Darwin observed human species HELP preserve weakest;  not pure survival of
fitest.

- caution on FREE THINKERS, some anti-religion b/c of hatred of 'lower
		clases', ie very conservative.

- ditto for birth control b/c reduces children of 'unfit' classes.  Spencer
		prefers 'survival of fitest':  why waste money/reforms on lower classes.

Bryan - sounded like Fundamentalist.  Not quite.   His objection to
evolution:  IF man incapable of rising above lower animal instincts, then
SOCIAL REFORMS (ie done by us imperfect people) DOOMED to fail.  More modern
(?) social reforms necessary to CONTROL worst of human animal side.  ???

Scopes -  Though Bryan initially  won in court, the decision was actually
overturned on appeal (technical issue). Then appeals court closed  case,
without clear resolution on the main issue.  Should religious doctrine
(CREATION) be allowed in public school was never argued?

-	Reaction:  North saw victory (Bryan had looked out-of-touch); became less
vigilant. South:  rise of anti-evolution.  Backlash. What had not been much of
issue, became a southern cause.  


-	Ex:  1921 - Darwin on cover of Biology books.  1926 edition -he is gone.
	Evolution removed from southern textbooks.  LESSON:   do not put your
	teachers on trial, just change books.  True today!  Report (1936) Biology
	@1900 had more science than 1936.  Creation remained LAW in many states;
	Texas much of 20C and certainly after 1980s.

  *  **J. Howard Pew** (Sun Oil) capitalism and religion do NOT conflict.  Use of
      religion in conservatism. Prior mostly just rich, anti-New Deal, or
      ideology (Ann Ryan, a few university profs). Pew wants return to
      fundamentalism.  Opposes Niebuhr and liberal Christian ideology.

      **Billy Graham** (1955)

\section{Ludendorff}
-   6/14/1914 -assassination \
-   Schlieffen Plan - Paris in 4 weeks; then Russia in 4 months;  Route through
Belgium,  not directly from Alasce into France b/c too well fortified.  But
Belgium resists more than expected.   Gen Ludendorff uses new gun and breaks
through.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlieffen_Plan
-   But Russians move too soon.   DUO of Ludendorff and older, aristocrat
Hindenberg defeat Russians by analyzing the two Russian armies and defeat
them separately. **Battle of Tannenberg**   However, what appeared as military success
violates Schlieffen Plan.    Germany faces  **TWO FRONT WAR**  Argument
Germany could have sued for peace and everyone could have gone home.
-   **Rathenau** Jewish industrialist; brilliant planner; and keeps Germany
    economy afloat.    Not why did the war take 4 years, but how did Germany
    survive for 4 years.
-   East or West, Kaiser dithers between 1914 and 1916 while military asks him
    to choose which one first.  Falkkenhayn (military leader in charge) says
    East; Ludendorff says West.
-   Faced with no choose,  Falkkenhayn devises Verdun Plan, control area
    around **Verdun** and bleed the city dry.  Falkkenhayn [^1] is realist and able
    general, but this is a Military failure;  almost equal deaths; pointless
    as French General activates superhuman logistics effort.  Falkkenhayn now
    replaced with Ludendorff.  Post Verdun Ludendorff + Hidenberg as figure
    head in control.  Will control army + govt as effective military
    dictatorship. :    
    :[^1] FALK also sought political way to end war; Russia was not favorable
    and German diplomats not eager;  another failure.
-   Turnip Winter (1916-17)
1916
-   British blockade Germany; Germans down to 1000 cal/d, starving.  (German
army always had enough to eat, unlike Russian army, German general and
aristocracy clueless about actual conditions in population.  England has
enough food sources no starvation.
-   Haber tells Ludendorff can produce enough fertilizer or poison gas NOT
    both.  His wife is so upset with what her husband does she commits
    suicide. 1918 Germany.
-   Whatever Ludendorff asks, the German people provide.   It was never for
    enough for Ludendorff who had no understanding of people, soldiers, war,
    death, starvation.  He is to blame; not the German people.  Ludendorff
    regarded as brilliant tactician (Take that hill!) but absolutely clueless
    how to defeat an army or win a war.       
    Russian General Brusilov defeats Austrian army (date, significance?)
-   Claim in 1916 Germany could have very reasonable peace deal.  Ludendorff
    either intimidated a weaker Kaiser or fooled him and the industrialist
    class, as well as the people that great victory lie ahead. A big lie.

-   March '18
        German military almost breaks French-British line in France. High
        point.
    -   Oct '18 German Revolution begins?    Reason why Ludendorff sees loss?


## Rise of Hard Right:  anti_New Deal.
  *  hate National Recovery Act's price controls; profanity to business.
  *  Assorted groups in 1930s-1950s, Leonard Read (Chamber of Commerce, vast
      networking, Foundation for Econ Education) Liberty League (duPonts)
      National Association of Manuf.  These are not nice people; have agenda.
      Barody (American Enterprise):  soft touch, `policy papers` to give to
      Congress.  Others:  Eventually pursue mass audience, get mass recruits
      (not just business or ideology or religious)
  *  By 1978, Powell memo; Kenysian not working; corp MUST get into poltics.
      First use of PAC. Coors.   Prop 13 (Laffer had hand?  cut taxes, watch
      GDP soar).  Heritage Found (Coors).  Jack Kemp:  stop regulating, cut
      cut cut; GDP will be unleashed. 
  *  More post-Powell:   Business Round table (soft touch, CEOS only; direct
      reach to pols, both D and R;  and Carter, NO social issues, Softer touch
      but same as Bouleware or Goldwater)  Chamber of Commerce (not big biz;
      "entrapenues",   Amyway - DEVOS - "American Way".   Anyone can join C of
      C. more aggressive, freedom and capitalism; populist; more like political
      party than lobbyist)

## Smith Act (1940)  advocate, even teach, overthrow US govt is criminal
(1958) SCOTUS:   standard must be call to action.

Esther Cooper Jackson (1917-2022), 
-   South, Brooklyn, Detoit
-   "Freedom Ways" (editor)
-   worked with W.E. DuBois  (SEE bio by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Levering_Lewis 
-   1940 AG Tom Clark, South Negro Youth C... (later SNCC) is subversive.
-   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Cooper_Jackson
    ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Cooper_Jackson  )
-   National Committee to Defend Negro Leadership; Families of Smith Act

## Ayn Rand, novels, 1943-1957.
(1958) SCOTUS:   standard must be call to action.
  *  "common good" is awful |  self-interest paramount |  it is better moral
      code than even religion (?!)
  * property:  absolute right to do what you want w/ property.  No govt
      interference  Business loves her.

## Sen Taft, isolationist
1938 - New Deal stirs hatred of rich | will bring socialism; isolationist.


##  Unconditional - notes from book; Japanese surrender.
  * Work with japanese 'moderates':  US Amb toJapan in 1920s, "Jap" experts: 
       Grew and Dooman (but 1920s Japanese rulers very different  from
       militarists) ; Hoover (!) - Stimpson Doctrine, based on observations of
       1st round of Japanese aggression, 1931: moderates will soon prevail.
       FDR had provoked Japan??
  * Russia Hawks, GOP & Hoover, Russia will dominate a weak China; must
      negotiate with Japan asap before Russia enters war against Jap. Russia
      is now bigger fear.  On other hand, as against Hitler, let Russia take
      the caualties to fight Japan.
  * Other US factors:  US pop is war weary;  GOP pillared Wilson for pursuing
      14th points rather than unconditional German surrender.   Iwo
      Jima/Okinawa (April - June 22, 1945): ferocious Jap fighting. 1942
      elections:  Dem lose 45 in H, 9 in Senate: New Deal in retreat.
  *  Marshall (Army Chief of Staff) `thinker`:  invasion necessary for Jap
      surrender.   Stimson (War), Know (Navy)
  *  Japanese:  Togo (Foregin Minister): end war NOW, but all other seek
      a battle victory before negotiating.  Military (fight, fight till win):
      plan to mobilize entire nation, including suicides.  Generally, Japanese
      feel time on their side,  attrition hurts US more than Jap; buys time.
  *  June 8, 1945.  Susuki, now head of state, reaffirms fight, not negotiate.
  *  Then Kido (head of govt) plan (doomed) withdraw from former EU colonies, 
        ask Russia to mediate; this is "daring" attempt to modify Jap Army
        plan. didn't happen.
  *  June 18, 1945  consent for delegation to Moscow, but Jap Army/Navy may
      contact Russia  ONLY after Japanese battle victory.
  *  Hirhito



\section{US Policy - end of WWII }

Fulton: Churchill speak for war; at time many criticized; Truman, present,
also not pleased.

1946 - most US scientists:  what have we done?
DEBATES:    Share knowledge? Cooler heads knew Russians would catch up; but
hawks rise.
Truman disliked Oppenheimer;  things Russians will "never" catch up.
Influence by his own racial prejudices.  Truman captured by hawks does not
even want to share with British.
Acheson-Litelton (influenced by Oppenheimer) - share bomb with world, to
manage it.  Barauch presents to UN (6/46), aging, poor choice, did not believe
tenets himself.
AEC:  civilan control of US bomb, not military.


1947 HUAC / Hollywood, Reagan 
-   1930s HUAC formed to investigate German Bund and Communists;  soon to zero
  in only C-.   1938 foreign agents to register, only actual legislation
  enacted.  Martin Dies (D-TX) anti-progressive soon becomes Chair and uses
  for power.  HUAC reauthorized every year.
-   Hollywood unions > 1935, mixed:  some good, some not;  SCOTUS:  Hollywood
  IS subject to 1935-Wagner Act (artists originally exempt)
-   Many in Hollywood sympathetic to progressive causes (range, in
  dedication). Several wrote scripts with references in some way to good
  causes, in movies otherwise very non-political.  Smallest of big 5 was RKO
  and most liberal:  Dore Schary "Until the time it is proven that a C-
  dedicated to overthow of gov't, I can not determine any ground for hiring
  but, by the man's competance."   But many faced backlash from Right hysteria
  for their views.   Others supported by money, by organizing others, by penning
  comment here and there.   Maybe one or two card-carrying C-, but most
  sympathetic to various progressive views, or simply wanted their work to be
  truthful, some simply anti-Nazi.

-  evil:
  Ronald Reagan ("friendly witness")
  Hedda Hopper, vicious anti-New Deal
  Tenny - vicious Calif state Rep

-   good:
  Lester Cole - objective film re: Burma
Lillian Hellman - sharp tounge, anti-Huac 
Edward Dmytrk, director, included religious toleratance (Crossfire, 1947)
Emmet Lavery, lawyer, 
Committee for 1st Amendmand
Dorothy Parker, Edward G. Robinson, Melvyn Douglas, John Ford



1947
Awareness European economy poor.  Spring ==> Marshall.\
March '47:  Loyalty Order, signed by Truman!  Hoover, Ambassador Hurley
(China) disloyalty has entered US gov't (!?) Chill falls over federal
employees, finger prints, a few fired.

\textbf{ National Security Act}
-   Military under unified (ref to 1941 attackZ), civilian command.
-   War Department (army) + Navy; both military at head  ==> Defense Dept (civilian)
-   National Security Agency:  coorindate, military + foreign policy (vs.
State Dept ??)
-   `world policeman` enters debate in Congress.


## US, WWII VP Wallace, Am style facism.
- 1944?   "build a wall around the US so high and so secure that not a single
		alien or foreign refugee from any country ... could possibly scale or
		ascend it."   Senator Reynolds (D-NC, Military Affairs Committee,
		isolationist, racist, wealthy; "Fortess American")

- Henry Wallace,  April 9, 1944: 
-
- "The American fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate
- perversion of truth and fact.   Their newspapers and propaganda
		carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity, every crack in the common
		front against fascism. They use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their
		own selfish imperialism.  They cultivate hate of and distrust of both
		Britain and Russia.  They claim to be super-patriots, but they would
		destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution.  They demand free
		enterprise but their spokesman for monopoly and vested interests.   Their
		final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture
		political power so that, using power of the state and the power of the
		market simultaneously, they may keep the common man in eternal subjection.


##  GE Strike, Boulware
-   1946 strikes catches GE off guard (huh?).   Emerges Boulware:  GE is boss,
    not union.  You take what we give; no matter how long you strike.

##	HUAC
-	claim:  there really was effort by CPUSA and "popular front" to disseminate
organizing, education, labor activities.  But overthrow?? 
-	1947, 1948 (?) investigates communist influence in Hollywood (actors,
directors, writers ...)  Vicious.   Many those targeted had liberal leanings or
depicted another side of life in their works, films  themes like religious
tolerance, anti-Semitic (ex:  John Wayne film
ALSO shows heroism of fighters in Burma?)   HUAC forced you to take
stand or they would end your career.  Some, including an RKO executive Dore
Schary , stood their ground ("Until the time is proven that a Communist is dedicated to
overthrow gov't,  I can not determine any grounds for hiring but the man's
competance.

##  William F Buckley emerges:
  *  pro-McCarthy
  *  anti-'elite' liberal education
  *  labor union "monopolies"
  *  he seeks non-business adherents to conversative (more ideological)


##  John Birch Society, real person
-   1939 rural Georgia, bible-thumping family, graduates college.
-   1940 July Shanghai China as missionary
-   1942 by how fluent in Chinese, saving souls, he works among Chinese;
meets Doolittle. (APR).   In July '42 Flying Tigers (volunteers) now called
"US-China Air Task Force" (Chennault) and in '43 becomes 14th Air Force.  To
survive, Birch joins US army in China.
-   1943 Birch in Chansgha, behind Japanese lines provides intelligence re:
Jap troops, status of airfields.
-   1944 (July) Chennault awards Birch metals for his work.  Birch seems to excel at
everything he does. (Oct) Vinegar Joe is out. Gen Wedemeyer in (too
sympathetic to CCK)
-   1945 (late August) war over.   Birch and party stopped by Communists (not
something unusual or alarming).  But Birch is tired, weary from war ... makes
threatening move and is killed.  A tragety , but not a hero. his fault.
-   AFTERMATH:  Wedemeyer talks down to Mao, bad move.   Mao protests had
saved dozens of American pilots, knew nothing about his indicident.   Beside
you are operating in our country, area controlled by us, why didn't you inform
us of operations?   Later testimony, Birch did provoke.  Birch knew Chinese
well-enough not to act this way.    Later, US army does
NOT award medals, not a hero, US & China were on **same side**    Zhu-de does
investigate writes report.   Mao does take incident seriously, but facts point
to Birch's own error.    US Wedmeyer and Ambass Hurley ... choose CKK.
Americans just too arogant.    **US-China cooperation effectively begins to end.**

-   Sen Knowland, anti-communist since at least 1946, makes speech in 1950.
Birch's mother endlessly lobbies.    First American death of next war?   Just
spirals on and on.   Welch, of Sugar Dadddy, Junior Mints, Pom-poms,  looks
for symbol.   Welch part of well funded effort..... 

-   1952 Taft also sees communistis everywhere.  But Eisenhower gets
nomination.   Birch Society forms actively in 1957? 1958?



## IKE and presidental power
John Foster Dulles dies in June 1959;  thaw begins in East-West. Major
conference set for 1960, Paris.    Failed. 
IKE  even was tiring of Nixon's  infatuation  with seeing REDS everywhere.
NO.  The event was U-2 shot down.  
Message by You: IKE *seemed* to have some
decent instincts. But he also tolerate or set the stage for all kinds of bad
shit., Saturday, December 12 2020, 12:33 PM IKE *seemed* to have some decent
instincts.      But he also tolerate or set the stage for all kinds of bad
shit.  

One legacy: creeping Presidental power to make war. He
got Senate approval for various forgotten incidents in Taiwan, Lebanon that
would allow future presidents to have all kinds of undeclared wars., Saturday,


Adlai Steveson: After Senate passed one of these 85-3,
Congress has given president a "blank check".,

## Goldwater:  1957 hearings.
Hates unions, "freedeom", no one should challenge the boss.   Walter Ruether
at hearings.

##  JFK
  -  To balance conscience and job, he promised to resign if ever conflict!
-	Both JFK and esp HHH supported clause  allow govt to arrest/detain
subversives in times of national crisis.   1962 Cuban Missile,  FBI Hoover
kept list and called many such subversives (anonymously, to track them). JFK
did not declare emergency.  Bernstein's parents of (Berstein/Woodruff)
receieved phone calls.

##  Watergate
REF:  book Goliath
1972 - Watergate babies, young, `liberal`, college-educated and definitely anti-war.  Replace
old man, Wright Patman (D-TX), 1928-1972, who believed in preventing monopoly
power.  He was last of generation like Brandeis who oppposed bigness,
concentrated power (though may be different reasons).  In 1930s, he passed law
to prevent A&P, chain store, from offering various discounts, rebaits that
made mom&pop difficult to compete against.  He had no problem with
"efficiency", or that mom&pop could offer better service.  He opposed
concentrated power to UNFAIRLY change playing field.   That was "fair trade"
meant in 1930s.

Both Hofstader and Galbrieth praised big business!   H- argued American
triumph & prosperity due to big corporations.   G- did not focus on `class
struggle`, is that Liberal means?

A&P law become symbol of opposition to gov't. :
deas of Limiting big business persisted to 1960s (by mostly old men).   Began change
in Democrat Party away from working people, fairness, economic issues.


## SCOTUS
    - Did you know this ???     From SCOTUS oral arugment ....   "political
  promises"    are not contracts, not enforceable,  not legal justification to
  replace the politician!

##  Mon  14 Dec 2020  50 years from now, today will be remembered as ....
 - Day USA passed 300K covid deaths
 - Day USA began vaccinations
 - Day AG William Barr resigned
 - Day Electoral College voted Biden President.
 - Day American people began to realize EC must be replaced.
 - Day American people began to realize Constitution out-of-date.
 - Day American people began to realize how much damage Trump had done to
     USA.
 - Day American people began to realize USA is in decline.
 - Known for some other reason.
 - Long forgotten day.



##	Lorraine Hansberry (Rasisen in the Sun)
-	1930s, raised in area south/west of Washington Park (between Cottage and
Grand (MLK))
-	some areas black, some white .... Woodlawn all white.
-	father chopped up apts to make room for steady flow of north-bound black
migrants.  Made him rich.  but ran into racial covenants.  Sued.  (He is the
new LANDLORD as bldg change owners).  Very ambiguous to me:  what were racial/economic boundaries?
-	attends public schools; mixed white;  Lorraine is cursed, spit upon, etc
for father's suit against covenants.
-	2 older sisters attend Howard U; `popular` rich young black women; arrive
with multiple trunks in toe.
-	not so, Lorraine; attends U Wisc; scholarship;  contends with
	implicit/explicit racism; blossoms into rebel but endears all who come
	within in her reach.  eventually Communist.


\section{finance}
-   1987 crash?   not due to economic conditions;   failure of Black-Sholes
model (buy puts, 'insurance') to protect against falling markets.   Can't do
that when everyone is doing same; and market is crashing.

##  Eugene, OR
Judge Alfred Ted Goodwin, 1923-2023
father was Baptist minister;  
-   ordered cross removed from Ore. hiltop.
-   beach bet high tide and vegetation is PUBLIC (1964)
-   Nixon appointed to fed bench.
-   favored **federal** enforcement to protect Spotted Owl
-   forcing children to recite "one nation under god" violates separation of
Church. (unfortunately, reversed in separate case when 'teacher led')
-   also branded cattle (man of the west?)
