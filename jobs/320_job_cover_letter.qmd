In different settings, I have done a range of database-related projects.
However,  in  past several years I have focused on R, its related packages and
uses.

Like many, I could be happy moving ahead to the new challenges in genomics, ML
and modeling large amounts of data.   However, from my own experience I know a
better intermediate goal is to solidify what I do know and fill in any gaps or
weaknesses.  My goal now is to improve the craft of R coding and data science
in general.

So for example, I have used various ways to validate inputs and catch
exceptions, but I have not settled on a preferred way to do this.  I could say
the same about using tidyverse or much more succinct data.table.  

The kind of position I feel I could immediately contribute would be a team
environment, but in support role, for example

-   wrangle data, or improve workflows, pipelines
-   refactor code
-   improve function documentation
-   write tests
-   work through know code issues
-   help document project best practices and coding style
   
Of course, I would like to maintain exposure to modeling process, EDA,
graphics.   But this can be done during down time, or my own time.

You will notice a gap in my resume for the years I lived overseas in China.  A
rich, broaden experience.   I did teach an introductory java course and then
set up and managed a popular website for both Chinese and foreigners to
exchange information in and around Dalian, China.

I hope to be considered for a  role in your group and begin to contribute.

Earlier Projects:
    I did a number of database projects mostly with the Paradox database and
    some MySQL.  These included a law firm conflict database; large
    multi-table database for real estate (joint ventures and individual
    properties)
