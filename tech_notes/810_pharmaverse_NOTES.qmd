## Tools

For Package:  Use these:

- styler::style_pkg() \
- devtools::lint()   # package   \
- devtools::test_coverage()   # entire package 
- devtools::spell_check(use_wordlist = TRUE) # package 
- spelling::update_wordlist(pkg=".") # runs spell AND asks to update WORDLIST  

For File:  Use these:

- active_fie =  rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path 
- devtools::test_active_file() 
- devtools::test_coverage_active_file()
- styler::style_file(path = )   # dir, file
- lintr::lint(filename="")
- spelling::update_wordlist(pkg=".") # runs spell and asks to update WORDLIST

(see lintr package - many options to control nolint)
https://lintr.r-lib.org/articles/lintr.html
lintr::lint()

```
# nolint start
...
# nolint end
 ```

### Rhino
Ref: good video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmyilJr7jXs
- framework, method to keep shiny apps organized and modular: by using
  separate file/directory for config (.yml files); testing, logic
  (code without shiny), view (ui), global
- when needed, use by pieces or whole.
- box container-like in R




## FAQ

**In tests, how to check correct error/warning is issued?**

-  Please use expect_snapshot() to ensure that the correct error
message is issued.  By the way, unit test for errors and warnings
should never accept any error or warning but always check that the
expected one is issued (by using expect_snapshot() or the class
argument of expect_error()/expect_warning() ).

**Is my version of admiraldev, pharamverse, out-of-date?**
- Check:  Namespace file & packageVersion("admiraldev")
- install latest from github by using devtools::install_github("pharmaverse/admiraldev"

When we depend on a dev version of a package, we should also indicated this in our DESCRIPTION file FYI

Imports:
    admiraldev (>= 1.1.0.9006),

It used to be the case, that Remotes: would re-install all pkgs listed in Remotes upon installation of the pkg, but that is no longer the case after pak replaced remotes for GH intallations.


*Skills to focus on:*
https://pharmaverse.slack.com/archives/D07DL8CP00G/p1728234941977779
 `templates, documentation & navigation, pkgdown & organization, R environments`


*Data:*
https://pharmaverse.slack.com/archives/D07DL8CP00G/p1722857716071859

*What is "starting date" ?*
    When is example data contrived, from CDISC, a subset etc. the data usually starts at Informed Consent - RFISDTC

*When to use metacore/metatools ?   Or,   admiral?   Seems to be overlap.*

    Yes there are lots of overlap between the packages.  For example, there are functions in metatools to bring copies of variables from SDTM or you could just use dplyr or base R to bring them over.  We built them independent so you didn't have to commit to them if you wanted to use one or the other.  I use both in my ADaM programming and work well together.  I think the example site has best example.

*How many "ADaM(s)" are there?*

    3 types of Adam (ADSL, BDS, occ...)   Is there ONE ADSL or many kinds;  was very confused about this.

    There is only one ADSL in each study, but each study's ADSL will
    look different depending on what is needed for Subject-level data
    as defined in the Study SAP (Statistical Analysis Plan), for
    example baseline tables and endpoints.  There is a forth ADaM
    called ADaM Other - which captures some exotic ADaM structures.
   

*Templates:*
(not FAQ, a direction) We are trying to compare things from the templates in CI Workflow; use of diffdf

Why do we use both library(pharmaversesdtm::ae) and ae=pharamaversesdtm::ae

We are just trying to be explicit on where the data is coming from as
we are assuming folks are not super familiar with R yet if they are
using our template programs.  Yes we could drop the library() call,
but the comment on the datasets origin is important to also point out
to new users.


*What topics does bi-weekly Admiral meetings cover?*

A lot of what we make is based on the Study Design and questions being
asked in the study to prove the safety and efficacy of the drug
through something called the SAP (Statistical Analysis Plan).  So
which ADaMs, TLFs you pick is really dependent on the SAP.  There is
something called the Protocol that is a higher-level version of the
SAP which influences the eCRF (electronic Case Report Form) and
determines what data is collected.However, you will always have an
ADSL dataset!!

We have bi-weekly meetings on Wednesdays at 10 AM US EST.  They are
not mandatory to be in the group but highly encouraged.  You get to
meet various people and participate in discussions.  However, we
understand that can be tough with full-time job needs.  Occasionally
we split out into Working Groups to tackle various topics.

*History of package datasets*
https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/D07DL8CP00G

I'm not worried about creating the data in admiral.  I believe this is
the way forward that you have been working on.We have been doing it
for 3 years now just not using the recommended data/data-raw
convention.The pharmaverseadam package was created to allow folks to
load ADaM data for other projects rather than having to load admiral.
We actually used to have all those ADaMs in admiral but it bloated the
package and decided to remove them.  So pharamverseadam came later and
it is a little confusing as our templates make those ADaMs and so adsl
is identical between the two packages.The templates should create the
datasets (adsl and adlb).  admiral_adlb should require some subsetting
with the proposed Subjects.  If the data is not an exact match, then
it would be nice to understand what is not matching.  The diffdf
package is very nice for this.If it doesn't match, then lets figure
out why and it might just be a minor updates to the templates that
have been done over the last few years.  AGain I'm not particular
worried as the package hasn't changed so drastically that the Hy's
Vignette would become unusable. (edited)

Once you do a few more successfully merged PRs I will propose to core
team that you be included! Be great to have you involved.

*Reviewers: PR*
(Ben) So I see everything that happens in admiral: issues, conversations,
PRs, etc as I have my settings that way.
Yes always assign a reviewer.
You can ping people you have interacted with and ask for review or use
@pharmaverse/admiral teams to ask for additional reviewers.
If crickets, ping on slack as well; Stefan is the best for thorough
code review.  Edoardo and I are okay for code, but we are very user
focused and pay close attention to documentation of usability of the
function.
there are a few others out there but you haven't interacted
with them much yet

** R Working Group
*** Pilot 4
*** Pilot 5
** Chronology

<2024-09-16 Mon>
- Still to do, create:
  -data/admiral_adsl.rda
  -data/admiral_adlb.rda;
  -verify that Hy's Law template creates same dataset.

- As I understand things,  to do this,  I need
  (1) functions from admiral,  inluding
  inst/templates/ad_adlb.R
  inst/templates/ad_adsl.R
  and,

  (2) minimal datasets from  package:pharmaversesdtm.

- Said another way, we are **using admiral package itself to create datasets for the admiral package**!! (chicken & egg?)

- This makes me a little nervous;  especially since I have not worked through most of code base
- For example, merely by loading **admiral** I populate ("pollute") the  environment and specifically add
  -data/admiral_adlb.rda,
  - and admiral_adsl.rda

- These are very datasets I am trying to create from scratch..

- I have not tried since Friday, but keeping track of what already exists vs what I am creating was getting messy.

-   Is there a better way?
    That's where I am.  I have some thoughts, but first - is there a problem?   Or am I making up a problem ??


<2024-07-15 Mon> - Reorganizing, in process
<2024-07-08 Mon> - Added original *Progamming Strategy* (from Admiral, .Rmd file) to this document.
- First, pandoc -f markdown -t org -o orgmode.org RMDfile.Rmd
  - Intent is to do add *my annotations*

    <2024-08-02 Fri> Attached is messy pencil sketch.
    It is my comprehension of pharmaverse at this moment: confused! It
    is snapshot in time, mostly for me not you guys. As I see it, the
    overall process is a sequence of database 'states' and
    'transitions'. The sketch should depict the tables, key fields,
    links between at each state. The specific terms (CDISC,
    derived_var_*) are less important at this level. An R or database
    programmer should readily get the idea, even if clueless about the
    context or purpose. So Admiral or other package function too low
    level for this. Next: I want to fill in the gaps, errors roughness
    so I gradually see how the pieces fit together. If it will be
    useful as REFERENCE, I will be happy to aim for that. Now I am
    just trying to figure out what I know/what I do not know. Most of
    this from Coursera and two recent videos you and Ross did. Then
    github package documentation begins to make much more
    sense.

    <2024-08-21 Wed>
    Updated Plan for Issue # Situation
    
    SITUATION NOW:

1. *data/*.rda* Path  to created data.
2. *inst/example_scripts/\*.R*   Path to  \*.R files,  create \*.rda files.

AFTER:

1. (NO CHANGE) *data/\*.rda* Path to original data. 
2. (NEW) data-raw/\*.R       Path to new code. 
3. (REMOVE?) inst/example_scripts/*.R   Path to old code.


To effect this, propose these  intermediate steps:

1. (Temporary) Add: old_data/ folder to hold copy of \*.rda files. 
2. Empty: data/  .
3. Run: new code (data-raw/*.R)  New data saved in data/*.rda
4. Run: test.R (or equivalent as testthat) verify old and new code produces IDENTICAL *.rda files.
5. Pause for review/discuss 

As a final step

1. Remove folder and old code inst/example_scripts/*.R  
2. Remove old_data/*.rda   (copies of orginal data)
3. Remove test.R, 
4. PR


As initial run through:
1. Do this for example_qs.rda ONLY
2. Pause for review/discuss.
3. Then to for all remaining *.rda files

How to document this?

' @param derivation The derivation function to call
#'
#'   A function that performs a specific derivation is expected. A derivation
#'   adds variables or observations to a dataset. The first argument of a
#'   derivation must expect a dataset and the derivation must return a dataset.
#'   The function must provide the `dataset` argument and all arguments
#'   specified in the `params()` objects passed to the `variable_params` and
#'   `...` argument.
#'
#'   Please note that it is not possible to specify `{dplyr}`
