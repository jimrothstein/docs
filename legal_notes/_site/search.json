    "text": "auto accident, 2023-08-26\n\nFriday, 9-10 pm, returning from grocery shopping, attempting to slide in only open parking space on streeet in front of office. Done this many times. (HULL center patrons fill up most slots on street). West side of Willamette, I am driving south.\nGlasses on; street lighting good; had just completely illegal U-turn on Willamette (only recently began to do this). Seat belt on; no drinking; no distractions. No right mirror (same for several years).\nSometimes I parallel park, but this time attempted to slide in front first, directly in front of red truck (ie to south). Generous parking spaces and done this many times before. Speed - 5 mph? more? Suddenly car lurged. Body, restrained by seatbelt, also lurged foward. VERY suprised. What did I hit? Red truck (TUNDRA) on right, but it did not seem close. Surprised. Not convinced I did this (clearly I did.)\nMistake two. Did not leave vehicle, but tried to backup and straight wheel. But each time easing forward, connected with red truck. Tried to backup and really turn wheel; same thing. Still unclear what I hit; did my roof contact with underside of his large left mirror??\nAfter a few more attempts, got car to move away from truck and go foward to parking spot in front of truck. However, the car slid in to curb at sharp angle. Ok, back up again (I’m clear of truck at this point). But each time, car goes back to curb. Tried several times.\nWith flashers on (car rear end protrudes into street). Get out. Front right wheel and left right wheel point in different directions! Push tire, try to reverse and straight (parallel to street) ; again no luck.\nStill at same angle; get out to examine truck. Seems minimal damage… fender mark; scapes below door, same height as fender mark. Its mirror seems OK. In street, I retrieve large metal bolt. Red truck or mine??\nTotal time? 10 min? Try to get car to drive forward; Try to push. No luck. Couple ask if I need push. But after consideration. Decide something wrong with steering and push won’t help.\nCall chuck, insurance company etc. Put away perishables (in office refrig) When I return, truck owner there. Kyle? Exchange insurance. he does not seem too pissed. Show metal bolt; not his. Kyle is pretty sure I connected first with his bumper. Very plausible.\nVarious phone calls, insurance, chuck etc. How did I do this? How could I so badly misjudge? What’s wrong with me?\nAnd what about the steering and the metal bolt? Assuming metal bolt related to broken steering: Did this happen just BEFORE hitting truck; DURING, ie turning wheel, trying to go back or forward. From position of bolt, certainly happened well before I was able to slide into parking slot. Bolt is adjacent to red truck’s door, but far into roadway; about where my steering column would be; far into roadway.\n\nvim:linebreak nowrap tw=81 fo=tqlnr foldcolumn=3"

If you can give me an hour or two notice, I can be elsewhere.\nVentilation.\nBy ventilation I mean regular airflow, i.e. removal of stale older air and replacement with either fresh outside or filtered air. In general the northwest corner of building has less air circulation. I have reported this before. It is less of a problem in winter, but quite noticeable in summer. covid-19 adds to everyone’s concerns.\nOpening the door to northwest hallway does seem to improve flow. I still smell the cleaner, but it is diminished.\nTemperature.\nDuring normal working hours, I do not have any problem with temperature, as long as I keep my door closed. Hallway is warm. After the 5 pm, things warm up quite a bit, but I understand that\nLysol smell.\nThe two cleaning people work very hard. Alex said he follows the direction of his boss and used lysol, but did not have the container. The lysol company makes a large number of lysol products and some have been approved for covid-19 use.\nIf they are required to use strong cleaners, of course I can stay away (with some notice.) but I hope this can be infrequent and less than 24 hours.\nHowever, I am not the only with strong dislike for this odor or the length of time it remains in the air.\n\nhttps://www.autopia.org/forums/interior-car-care/184194-getting-rid-lysol-smell.html\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/dhpjmw/lysol_smellfrom_hell/\n\nApparently, lysol can cling to clothes, carpets, car seats.\nJust fyi:\nCovid-19 cleaners.\n[ The CDC website offers 3 cleaning suggestions, including soap and water.] ( https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/reopen-guidance.html)\n[FDA: Hand Sanitizers] (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-drug-class/qa-consumers-hand-sanitizers-and-covid-19)\n[EPA approved for Covid-19] (https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2-covid-19)\nAlso, the EWG evaluates products for health and environment products. Some lysol are very good but some receive failing grades.\n[121 products: ] (https://www.ewg.org/guides/search/?page=1&per_page=15&q=lysol&utf8=%E2%9C%93&x=0&y=0)\n[F:] (https://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/1124-LYSOLBathroomCleanerSprayFreshApple/)\nThank you for your time.\njim rothstein"

My routine has been to arrive late and leave late (please see email 21 May 2020). But as I understood these words, I do not reside here, I am not here overnight. When I am not working, I am not here.\nI think you said that the last sentence of House Rule 9 was either re-interpreted or modified.\n\nRule 9 “Employees and Guests”\n… “No part of the office or Business Center may be used for overnight accommodation.” [Jan 2020]\n\nObviously I want comply with rules. You mentioned you had additional documentation to clarify Rule 9. This would be very helpful.\nPlease let me know when you have questions or additional complaints. The sooner I am aware, the sooner I can address these.\nThank you.\njim\n## xx Dec 2020 Kerri, Lead Community Mgr, trying reach me. My phone number is no good. I reply and l/m yes it is good number. Think I responded to every inquiry I got. Then nothing for several days."

Asked again she try to send email. - No other calls or voicemails, so ~4:30 pm, I leave her a second msg . - ~4:20 pm ? I call her. She calls back. - Says she rec’d my email to Kristine, but doesn’t seem to know content. - Best I can piece together: 24-hour access means “access”. Working late at night is violation of their lease with building and is not what they mean by “access”. So it is violation of my lease. - Ok, I ask for definitions, rules …. Seem to go in circles and I at one point I say she sounds like a politican. - At other points, she seems to throw out … 1 night is ok, but not every night; 10 - 11 pm is ok, not too far from normal working hours.\n- I keep saying telling me the rules, what hours are ok or not? Told her Kristine said there was documentation on this. - She says janitors say you enter and leave building. Yes, I try to stay out there way. - At one point she says, you here now (&gt; 4pm) and you were here (10 am) and you were till 3 am ….. cut her off, “Didn’t you read the email?” - So more circles, read the email! Asking for clarification. - Change to new topic: I say don’t want to make a big case out of it; I changed hours. I try to respond. - Point out: more than one way to discuss things that Regus doesn’t like, nicer ways. Said she understood. Pointed out: first year, I didn’t seem have any problems. She mentioned new manager. Said now it seems like everything I do is wrong. - Since we are talking: my memos re: ventilation or especially cleaning at beginning of covid. All go unanswered. it takes 2. - Ask to clean carpet, spots pre-date. Said they’d consider spot cleaning or whatever. - Wast of time. But believe am OK for now. Just stay on schedule they prefer or best I can interpret that (leave 10, 11) which she mentioned."

It can not be both - non-renewal and pay for rent.\nOn Monday, May 10 I emailed the local Regus management for clarification. On Tuesday, May 11 I emailed Regus head of customer support. As this time, neither has responded.\nYou are scheduled to draw funds, per April 30 invoice, on May 15, 2021.\nSince this may not be resolved to everyone’s satisfaction in the limited time, I have asked my bank not accept new charges from Regus.\nI am happy to pay the invoice, if and when this is worked out. Please notify the appropriate people at Regus that the payment set for May 15 will not go through.\nI do owe for April coffee ($30) and will make arrangement to pay you for this.

I am also well aware corruption at highest level of our government shocks few people.\nNonetheless, I urge you to lead in a forceful and permanent repsonse.\nYours truly,\nJim rothstein\n\nauto accident, 2023-08-26\n\nFriday, 9-10 pm, returning from grocery shopping, attempting to slide in only open parking space on streeet in front of office. Done this many times. (HULL center patrons fill up most slots on street). West side of Willamette, I am driving south.\nGlasses on; street lighting good; had just completely illegal U-turn on Willamette (only recently began to do this). Seat belt on; no drinking; no distractions. No right mirror (same for several years).\nSometimes I parallel park, but this time attempted to slide in front first, directly in front of red truck (ie to south). Generous parking spaces and done this many times before. Speed - 5 mph? more? Suddenly car lurged. Body, restrained by seatbelt, also lurged foward. VERY suprised. What did I hit? Red truck (TUNDRA) on right, but it did not seem close. Surprised. Not convinced I did this (clearly I did.)\nMistake two. Did not leave vehicle, but tried to backup and straight wheel. But each time easing forward, connected with red truck. Tried to backup and really turn wheel; same thing. Still unclear what I hit; did my roof contact with underside of his large left mirror??\nAfter a few more attempts, got car to move away from truck and go foward to parking spot in front of truck. However, the car slid in to curb at sharp angle. Ok, back up again (I’m clear of truck at this point). But each time, car goes back to curb. Tried several times.\nWith flashers on (car rear end protrudes into street). Get out. Front right wheel and left right wheel point in different directions! Push tire, try to reverse and straight (parallel to street) ; again no luck.\nStill at same angle; get out to examine truck. Seems minimal damage… fender mark; scapes below door, same height as fender mark. Its mirror seems OK. In street, I retrieve large metal bolt. Red truck or mine??\nTotal time? 10 min? Try to get car to drive forward; Try to push. No luck. Couple ask if I need push. But after consideration. Decide something wrong with steering and push won’t help.\nCall chuck, insurance company etc. Put away perishables (in office refrig) When I return, truck owner there. Kyle? Exchange insurance. he does not seem too pissed. Show metal bolt; not his. Kyle is pretty sure I connected first with his bumper. Very plausible.\nVarious phone calls, insurance, chuck etc. How did I do this? How could I so badly misjudge? What’s wrong with me?\nAnd what about the steering and the metal bolt? Assuming metal bolt related to broken steering: Did this happen just BEFORE hitting truck; DURING, ie turning wheel, trying to go back or forward. From position of bolt, certainly happened well before I was able to slide into parking slot. Bolt is adjacent to red truck’s door, but far into roadway; about where my steering column would be; far into roadway.\n\n\n\n2023-08-29 post-accident status\nAside from car, here is an update and where I am and where I think I’m going; hope not too depressing !\n\nRemember I came here in June 2021, claiming I’d stay for 3 months and was getting ready to look for a job.\nThat didn’t happen. Then June 2022 I got scabes which set me back 2-3 months, but by June 2023 I was still here\nBy job, I mean software job, programming. Here is wikipedia says about the kind of software I know:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language) There are jobs! Many in industry, research, medical, economics; where ever there is data, or “numbers to chunk”\nAthough I have shortcomings, I should be employable. In technical fields there are many temporary or project files; as well as a regular on-site employee. Increasing number can be done remotely: Often English flency isn’t even an important reequirement; able to do the work is most important.\nThe point is I have enough skills to get job. So I am not working? I wish I knew. There is long history here; so I’ll spare you. It’s complicated. think lots of people in this boat, but I have no dependents, no mortage, few expenses… months turn to years … to decades of poor work experiences.\nThis summer two small, but signifcant behavior changes have occurred.\n\n\n\nan notable increase in daily exercise and attending Democratic meetings (Not everyone’s cup of tea, the point here is that this is social and a big change. (2) sending resume, contacting people, marketing myself.\n\n\nThese changes are very recent, still small and tentative – and I wouldn’t mention it, except for the car:\n\n\n\nIf and when will I get job? Can’t say; sooner rather than later, but I work on it daily.\nWill I stay in Eugene? Could work remotely or job might require my presence, ie move\nIf I move, will the car come with? If PDX, then yes. If Cleveland or Omaha or …, probably not.\nIf I begin to work, will I continue to work? Or just have another meltdown, repeat of past work history. I dunno. I want to work in govenment, not private company, so maybe I will care for the work.\n\n\nWill I be in Xmas? June 2024? Hard to say; Too soon in job search;\nBottom line: Why am I telling you this. Will get the car fix ($1750 plus $100 inspection, if he will still do that. But there is a good chance I vanish soon, without car. So waste of money."

The 2022 increase over 2021 was +31% !\nI would like stay in the building and the building looks nicer than before.

Littany of suggestions, accuasations…. not a place for pit stop; not place to hang out with friends; do not offer heat, do not offer a comfortable and cozy place…. Whoa…I only asked to keep the cold out; you are welcome to watch what I do. Said I will be here 2 hours. She could see what I was doing because I had boxes out and working at make shift desk\n\nHer demeaner was a bit more than neutral; I asked her to show me where in the contract I must keep door open 100%; she said if not, she will add it. Accused ME of hositility not sure exact word she used; but direct effort to put blame on the customer. All I wanted was not to be cold!\nvim:linebreak nowrap tw=81 fo=tqlnr foldcolumn=3"
