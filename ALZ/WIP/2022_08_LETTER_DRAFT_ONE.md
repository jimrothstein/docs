\section{Introduction}

I am one of the listed victims in 18CR58947.  I have appeared before this court before, in
person, by phone and in writing.

New charges are now pending in Salem Muncipal Court.   However, that court has extensive
backlog and there is no date for trial.  For this and a other reasons, the District Attorney has
moved that probation be revoked.

This Court is now considering how those additional charges relate to this case and defendent.


I request this Court consider:
1.	Move the Salem case to this court, to simplify and expedite. 
2.	Extend the probationary period for this Defendent.
3.	Reaffirm the "zero tolerance" criteria and "behavior change" goal as
		originally enunciated in this case.
4.	Release to public domain sufficient documentation for the Public to
		understand how, in practice, these standards are being addressed.


\section{Civil Subpeona, besides it  is scam}


This case arose when DEF used illegitimate means to thwart legitimate use of
legal system, a "scam" she called it. [^legitimate] 

DEF plead guilty, was convicted and then entered a drug diversion program[^diversion] [^MCVTC] from which she graduated last year.

That process involved many parties, decisions, criteria, facts.   Most of it is opaque to public.

(how decisions are made, the criteria used, DEF progress,,police reports,  selection criteria, reasons to use diversion rather regular criminal prosecution, graduation criteria ....)

However, I have tried to follow this case and parallel ligitation via public record.  Accordingly, almost everything mentioned here is matter of public record.
[^disclaim]


\section{Recent Developments}

\subsection{New Actions}

My understanding of situation at this moment is:

-	Hearing to Revoke of Probation. [^Revocation]
-	Two new charges in Salem Municipal Court [^SalemMuni]


More data has been added by DEF.


\subsection{Hearings}

From listening to hearing in this court[^listen_date], the probation case can
not proceed because DA is determining whether or not remote testimony is
acceptable.  From my notes, two judges have referred to the current situation
as "unusual" or "not normal", and reluctance to proceed with a "contested"
case.[^judges_said]


\subsection{No change here}


For the same set of facts, I find myself simulateosly 

-	Crime Victim
-	Judgment Debtor [^ORCP71]


Def's probation is scheduled for end in 36 months (vs 60 prior)


This case has not been "normal" from the start [^normal]  


I write now to express concern 

I have previously reported to this court and the DA a number of incidents  that illustrate
lack of enforcement; inconsistencies; or possible outright  
violations of plea deal.

\section{What I see}

I have learned plenty in this case and probably have much more to learn.

I am now very aware of how complex this process can be:  
the police, the prosectuors, the defense, veteran's diversion courts,
corrections, numerous third-parties weighing   and, of course, the PUBLIC.  All tasked with purposes that  may not align in
any common way.

I have also learned that vast amounts of this is not in public view. [^public_view]
Of course, I want to respect the rights of the DEF, but I suspect some
restriction the PUBLIC's right to know, however, is for  other reasons. 
be.


Because so much is hidden, it is not possible to tell how much randomness or
bias slips into the process (benefit of doubt where it is not deserved)

[^public_view]:  Including for instance the many decisions big and small, who
	made the decison and why. decisions 	The law says "may", but this DA says yes or no.
Corrections or Veteran's court or any  gives the benefit of doubt, or not.  A
accountant declares an 'delinquent' or not.  This DA or that DA is assigned. 
A case is delayed and suddenly key witnesses go on active duty, leave the
state, covid-19.  A judge uses the wrong criteria.  A decision somewere deep in the process is done in error,
or is changed for valid (but unknown ) reasons.


Random:
-	witnesses go on Active Duty
-	witnesses move out of Oregon
-	1000 small decisions
-	each disclosre:  minimum or maximum.
-	covid-19
-	Judges who use wrong standard
-	


After experiencing the damanage that can be done in a court on 30August2018,
it is impossible for me to trust any process or individuals in criminal
process.

I very aware I am not seen as neutral observer,
but I tried very hard to stick to specific data that you could verify for
yourself. Or I have tried to point out patterns (hard to bat away, if not formal proof)


I have also learned, right or wrong, that I can not convience anyone to do
anything.


Where I stand, and with what I know, ie public information only this process has
failed.  And you do not know what to do now.  

You failed the DEF, you failed me, and most improtantly you failed the PUBLIC.

I am not saying you did this in any kind of malicious way.  From the facts I
know, given the particular facts and this DEF, you have just not performed adequately.




My take is a bit different and again based on my obsevations[^scratching] very
incomplete information;  you have much and better quality information that I
do. [^claim_no_expertise]

\section{NEXT}

My understanding of the xxxxxx Plea Agreement is that is there ONE version,
not one for the Public, a tougher sounding one for the Victim and yet a
third for DEF.

I was not party to the agreement, but this court room presided.
I ask that this court enforce that agreement.

I have numerous other suggestions.    The essence, however, boils to:

-	REQUIRE tranparency;  DISCLOSURE of all eligble documentation.
	-	PUBLIC needs to know
	-	Make it clear [^right] 
	-	threat that this person is
	-	that you do your job.
	-	Cloaking all this ... does not serve the public interest.[^cloak] 
-	Mean what you say; do what you say!
-	REQUIRE burden to DEF to prove veracity; not "benefit of doubt"
-	INCLUDES financial disclosure.
-	REJECT idea that more of the same will yield different results.
-	CHANGE your approach to DEF[^afraid]
-	EXTEND probation period.
-	ACT to prevent children being used in adult conflicts. (DHS should be
	involved)
-	ACT SWIFTLY, DECISIVELY.
-	REQUIRE lawyers be prepared BEFORE entering your room. 

-	Explain why you thought diversion was in anybody's best interest? [^diversion1]

If you can do nothing else, please enforce your own agreemnt.

fact, I done so before [^told_you_before]  among things I have learned is
pointless.


[^afraid]:   I admit I am.
-	Contested, yes will!
-	Appeal, yes will.
- pro se, yes she will.
-	Make your work much harder, yes she will.
-	Lie?  She admitted to doing so in the past.
[^diversion1]:  Repeatly told "right".    I see no such "right"  Whose
	interests did you represent by signing off on this?

[^right]:
Was told it she a "right" to it.
		ORS 135.881 - diversion? ORS 137.077 - pre-sentence report (not
		public) but *may* make available to victim. 
		ORS 137.090 -court "shall
		consider" .. mitigate, aggravate ..situations that include military; can
		not figure out more. 
		ORS 137.680 -to develop special courts (drug, vet

[^cloak]:  release police reports, audio, video to public domain to public
	domain.  And the all the intermidiate reports.

[^disclaim]:  Other than being around for several decades, I have no training
	or expertise  in the law, human behavior, criminal behavoir, veteran's
	affairs, child rearing or any  of the many areas broached by this and
	related cases.   I studied a bit of math, that is it.   Everything here can
	be viewed at courthouse computer or drawn my direct observation.

#	HOW YOU GOT to TODAY?

\section{introspection}
-	Many pieces came together:  criminal courts, police, veteran's courts,
	drugs, sentencing guidelines ....
-	As institutions, you failed.   You all failed.

-	You badly need to do this.
-	You have failed the PUbLIC.

\section{last you knew all this}
-	You knew all this.   You knew the DEF history;  Data was clear before any
	arrests were made.  You even assigned the right
	proseutater.   "Domino"  blah blah blah ... 
-	You just looked the other way when presented with evidence.  Shame on you.
	This is exactly why you must release all to the PUBLIC, so victims and
	PUBLIC do not need to track you.


But no one should be shocked:

From the very start of this case, you knew the DEF would be difficult. (many
footnotes:  police heard it before, assignment of prosecutor, `domino
theory`) prior felonies probabtion reports copious documentation, Judge Hart

You chose lienancy, vet's court, said one thing to me did another.  You don't
even follow your rules.   On June3, Judge Z said not a normal case! Did not
want 'contested' case ...






A change is necessary:
-	internal and external.

-	Did you make unwarranted assumptions?
-	Shift the burden:  REMOOVE benefit of doubt.
Skeptism; based on DATA.

-	You got a conviction, but what happened to the "behavior change?" part?

-	Did you miss patterns?
-	ARe you going through the motions?





End of story?


The original district attorney told me the objective was "behavior change" and
he was often assigned to more difficult cases.  He said 3 years in prison
would help effect that and that conviction would yield 'domino effect'.

I have learned a lot since then and still learning.

In this letter, I wish to convey my views to the Court at this point in time.
A snapshot, so to speak.

Upshot:

Process is cloaked in secrecy.   Many little and big decisions.  Outcomes, I
call as `data`.

So the Court has much more and higher quality information.  I only have what I
can read.  

Please bear this in mind:   I am trying to influence the trajectory based on
very incomplete information.   Is the goal still `behavior change`?

Failed.

You tried extreme leniency over my vigorous objections.  

you looked the other way, shifted the rules.

You did not do what you said you would.
FN:  prosector *may*

Cast it all in secrecy.
