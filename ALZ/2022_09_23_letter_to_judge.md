Dear Honorable Judge:


I am one of the listed victims in this case and have appeared before this
Court before.

From reading public files, I see no indication that the Defendant has changed
behavior.	As you know, the District Attorney filed a motion to revoke the
Defendant's probation.  That was a year and 6 months ago.

I am concerned about the persistent delay in acting upon this.

I encourage this Court to hear the facts, from both sides, and make a
determination consistent with the stipulated agreement and the law.  This
should be a public proceeding and done as expeditiously as possible.

I oppose any additional special arrangements.  

Thank you for your time.
