##	English translation:


1.	You fucked up.

2.	You knew from the very start this would be a difficult case.

3.	You choose plea deals, diversion.  Made it all opaque.   Fine.   And the
		Defendant outsmarted all of you!  See #1.

4.	Now you do not know what to do.   You are even afraid to have a "contested"
		proceeding!

5.	So you do nothing.  The pile of data continues to grow.

6.	In affect, you are subsidizing Defendant's   ad nauseam use/abuse of
		litigation.   At some point, real people might get hurt, including minors you
		claim to protect.
	
7.	Do what you (and the Defendant) already agreed to do!

8.	End this case - now.
