###	VETERAN's court 

{<!--{{{-->
-	DA must consider:  https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_135.886
-	also on DRIVE:
from https://www.courts.oregon.gov/courts/marion/programs-services/Pages/treatmentcourt-adult.aspx
|	The goal is to enhance public safety by stabilizing, habilitating and reintegrating dependence-free veterans back into our community utilizing federal and community resources.

from https://www.oregon.gov/odva/Resources/Pages/Justice-Involved-Veterans.aspx
| The law relies on the judgment of a prosecutor, who will determine on a case-by-case basis which defendants may be eligible for diversion. These prosecutors must consider, for example, whether a veteran who spent four years at a military base should be offered the same diversion opportunity as one who deployed twice to combat situations in Afghanistan or Iraq. Prosecutors must decide how serious the crime must be before diversion is taken off the table and must consider the victim of the offense.

### TUE May 3 2022 Probation Violation Hearing (by phone) Judge Matthew Tracey
-	DEF lawyer knows case, but still needs time.   (What did you do past since last hearing?)
-	waiting, muni court ruling May 18.
-	can not proceed here till muni court rules.
-	judge to DA, can witness (police?) appear by phone.  No ans.
-	DEF lawyer offers, promises, announces ?  that he will be "creative" with
	Mr. Wolf (DA assigned)
-	Judge says something to effect this case is "long overdue"
-	Judge ask ME if anything to add, no I do not.
-	NEXT:  June 3, 1:30 pm (as status, not hearing)

My comments:
-	DEF lawyer plays for time.
-	Assist. DA, not prepared.  Sense NO urgency.

###	Thu May 26 20:31:13 PDT 2022
	- called to listen; next hearing 6/3/2022 at 1:30 pm


###	Fri	 Jun  3 23:24:13 PDT 2022  Judge Natasha Zimmerman
	-	Hearing, judge Zimmerman (?), I am patched in.
	-	Patterson speaking; do not hear  anything from Wolfe or prosecution during
		hearing.
	-	Still waiting for Municipal Court (why?) Patterson thinks next hearing is
		June 28.
	-	Patterson still talking says Wolfe needs to reach out to officer
		availability.  
	-	Do we postpone?   Judge says normally yes; but something to effect that
		this case isn't normal, ie special or extraordiary case, or words to that
		effect.   (I appreciate).
	-	Discussion of "contested" hearing nor not?
	-	Seems to be agreed don't want "contested" hearing.   Judge suggests August
		1, 1:30 pm.   This will give Muncipal Court time to <what ?>.
	-	Patterson says try to be "creative" with Wolfe. 
	-	end of call.

Seem to be covering same ground as last hearing.  Despite both Judges raising
timeline issue; I see nothing happening; don't even do homework.

Should I calmly write Judge ... appreciate timeline concern ... but you have
here ...  prior violations; 3 years became sweetheart deal; despite tough talk
nohting happened when I brought conflicts with agreement to court;  Reminder
you have someone here who brought ficitious ligitation and then lied about
INSIDE a court room.   

\textbf{Behavior change:   If this is still the goal?	Respect for legal
system?}

##	Tue 09Aug2022  - call Salem Municipal Court

-	I call to Court; register to listen in on next hearing:  Sept 28.  Person reads from "notes"
They have a "notes" section, not public.   Waiting for MUNCIPAL COURT case to
resolve.  OK.  See notes in MUNI (above)

-	Salem Municipal Court (case details at top) Ms. Sanchez very helpful; 2 cases
	as noted at top; plead both non-guilty.
-	DA (city?) decided to prosecute.
-	Ms. Sanchez explained that Court very back logged from Covid-19.  Working
	with Def and her lawyer (who?) to arrange date for JURY TRIAL.
-	At this time, there is NO NeXT hearing Date.   Expected the case (trial?)
	will occur by end of year.
-	PUBLIC RECORDS request ... I also start this process online (with Salem
	City).	 Just to inspect court records?  Not too optimistic.

##  Fri 17Feb2023    Hearing, I listen
-   Judge Tiffany?
-   asks Braden if appeared before?   said something about "Golden Rods"
-   DEF says 'solo basis' is DUI - bullshit!   says not preprepared today for
    ??? (did not understand, maybe judge pushing this along)
-   asking for continuance; both parties are; joint request, so at end Judge
    grants.
-   Before that, Braden goes through same bullshit;  police office must make 6
    hour drive; he did so once before and it was continued.   Police officer 2
    on medical leave;  lab tech just returned to work.	 (This is crazy)

-   Braden repeat solo basis for probation violation is DUI.  (FALSE !).
    Says could do contested probation violation that would move case to
    Downtown and effectively become full case re: DUI.	 (yes, do that !)
-   Of course, nobody wants to.   Braden prefers wait for DUI in Muni court to
    play out.  Will "pester" Munic Court.  (Garbage ... I called last month,
    still no date; all unknown).
-   At some point, Patterson says was not prepared to admit or not DUI (or
    something to that affect).	(sounds like this Judge must have really
    pushed this!)

-   Then debate over next date; 1st march, then May, finally April 20th, 1:30
    pm.  Appreciate Judge walked it back, rather than going in ONE direction
    ... longer and longer.

-   Writing is SO clear:   everyone do as little as possible, hoping it goes
    away - even the PROSECUTOR !  SEE no evil.	 ALZ is just going to walk.  Prepare
    yourself!

    Judge did ask me.  I said nothing to add.	(Should I have said:  this
    case is over 2 years and plenty of violations?)


##  Also 17FEB2023, "waiver" Judge Underwood once worked in DA Office,
ALZ/DA/Def Atty all sign that this is not a problem.  Judge U is ok.

##  R 2023-04-20   (on phone) next hearing date set: May 18
Judge: 
Present:  Ms Hughes (da), usual guy (defense)
Defense:   Repeats `sole allegation` DUI, trial not set, and "lost hope" of
trial ... (didn't hear everything) So, requests hearing and will try to find
"creative solution" (arrrrgh) Judge assigns 1/2 hour May 18, Think he said
not-contested.

I speak:
[see](2023_04_20_address_to_Court.html)
[also letter to friend](2023_04_20_summary_to_friend.pdf)

Afterwords, judge has he wants to respond to me.Understands I am "frustrated"

1.  He is filling in for today.   He will not be judge at the hearing. And he makes no decisions.

2.  No other probation violations have been alleged in past 2 years.  (exactly!)

3.  I will be to speak at hearing, or appear in person.  Believe he also said can repeat my statement then.

##  R 18 May 23    -  Probation Violation - HEARING  - **ADMIT**
{
-   Call Salem Municipal;  DUI shows no future court dates; sending a note to
    new prosecutor (Nicole Theobald) to inquire (for their records, not for me.)

-   Call Bree of DA office, 503-373-4457; she sends subpeona.  Not permitted to
    say whether or not someone subpeona!  Gave me no info.  (Waste of time)
-   NO CALL from Court at Hearing Time (see below) Computer says lasted 5 minutes; 
|   Probation Violation - HELD
|   - Admit
Run over to Court computer.   Says same, no records (yet)

**Why NO PHONE CALL** ?
Call Advocates TWICE last week.   First time, receptionist said have someone call me.  I said just want to listen to hearing.
Date?	 At Court House computer; no mention to call victum.
Call Advocates AGAIN.	Says he  remembered me.  I repeat:   just want call from hearing.   He sends me to Court (downtown - wrong) Call annex and ask to have phone call.
Sent to ???? (no name) assures me get emails everyday from Advocates.	OK, I said I am just in the middle, please put me on call list. Thought she did.

So I call Court (annex) to complain.  Gives me name of schedule clerk:	 **Kimberly BLAKE**
Next day, Friday, hear message.  No name.  Says checked with Advocates;  never got any call/request from me!! Suggests go in Person to next hearing.  Crazy !!

}

### 5/23/2023  - l/m for Braden; never returned call.
I rec 5/19/2023 ltr that ALZ ; may plead guilty; confused since she just 'admitted'
Call to Victim Advocates (you were told ... not to;   ); ok, transferred to DA Office; Christina can not answer Q; so left voice mail for Braden;  what is happening?  thought she admited;  isn't this stipulated?  NEVER RETURNS CALL

## R 15 JUNE 2023  DEF pre-sentence recommendation
9 pages, much BS.   omits, distorts, incomplete on facts; written by lawyer Patterson
(I read this first time ~ Oct 2023)

## F 16 JUNE May2023	Probation Revoked; 36 months jail, Judge Mathew Tracey

-Def Patterson;  Prosectution Ms. Hughes; Judge:   
Hughes 1st; asks 36months and receits reasons;	 sound strong to me.  About the DUI:  Complaintant said ALZ was on property, banging on door and threatening to beat up complainant. Drunk.  Police give her DUI, take some measurement even though she refused breath test.

Patterson:   Advocacy is one thing, but this guy twists and omits some things.	Makes everything sound minimal.   "Boneheaded" was her actions in civil court.	Identify theft usually means signing up for multiple credit cards and the like.  Claims been good for 2 years.	Wants probation to be continued.   At some point says she laid out money (in LL-T) case.  (Also a lie)

I speak:   Not boneheaded!  Abuse of legal process.  Repeat statements from Judge Hart.   Purpose:    Behavior Change.

Judge asks for each to comment on setencing.
Again, Patterson can't get facts right.  Says I repeat statements from witnesses and do it each  time.	(True, but this is data and from JUDGE.   Where is YOUR DATA?)	 

ALZ:   wants to move on with her wife and family and chldren; how she volunteers (dogs) and all sorts of good things.  Claims to be homeowner.	Still victim:  only changed word from pet, still human urine (no mam!)	 
**NOTE:   Says I still owe her money !!**   She stalked and harassed (did not catch it:   I am doing this, x-wife, life ??)

Moral:	 Important to DOCUMENT; the way Angie Donhaoo did.  Examples:	nothing about still running illegal short term rental ("hotel"), suspicious financial; no school or work .... Failure to pay court on time. But PLENTY of ligitation while on probation.  No mention of 15DR civil case:  "vendetta agains her" or her behavior.   DA should have talked to me;  get underlying crime correct and conduct since.  


Judge reviews authority to extend probation.   2 cases; go through.  Discussion
about whether ALZ is '5i' or harser '5B'  Judge dismesses past need for bench
warrants. Totals up months.   Goes through each count.   Count 5 is big one:
36 months.	 Others 6 or 12 months, concurrently.  Will be reduced for good
behavor, no fees, no fines.   Formally revokes probation in both CASES.   Says
now 3rd violoation.


Some kind of sobbing in background.   Phone cut.

Conclude:   We wind up EXACTLY where started with Kallery and which she
rejected.     And the 5 year stipulated agreement ?   gone.




## Sun 18 JUNE23    MEMO TO FUTURE PROSECUTOR
1.  ALZ will return
2.  ALZ right combination of talent:
    -	smarts
    -	excellent people skills;  to sell; to fool Judges
    -	to find and cultivate people loyal to her
    -	to stay under radar screen
    -	to be fearless, unafraid, relentless when feels threaten by truth.
    -	to play the `victim`; never responsible
    -	to lie and lie, even when you have police report in front you.
    -	to intimidate, bully, frighten; few want to come forward.
    -	to abuse of ANY Benefit of Doubt
    -	to abuse any failure to verify compliance.
    -	to abuse legal process.
4.  You must Verify every claim. Challenge every financial claim.
5.  If you are uncertain, read the police reports; civil and family court
    files; her motions and Appeals.  ALZ appears to enjoy the legal process,
    pro se or with private counsel;  Decades of data.  Do not be fooled by
    court appearances.
6.  Document, document, even small infractions.  She chips away; but makes few
    big mistakes.   If you do not document, there will be a mountain of bad
    behavior but no `violations.`  (see how Angie Donhoo documented)
6.  Watch for one important ALZ error:	The lies do not stand up to slightest
    scrutiny. If you do not check, she will skate by and so usually does so.
    As I found in my case, the lies last long enough to fool judge.  With
    modicum of effort, her claims  rapidly unwind, leaving nothing but fables
    and felonies.

  Doubt I am the only such victim.
7.  Talk to people who were not fooled (most are).  AG Kallery or PO Angie
    Donahoo (Yamhill County)

### 2023-08-03
1.  Why/who allowed ALZ into Vet Court?  Who thought it would do anything?
2.  Define "tough".  But when late payments ('deliquent', but not for covid),
    lies to Judge, clearly still feels victim; still running 'hotel', DA does
    zero.	Why?  What purpose did that serve?
3.  Explain how 11 days after VET Court:  DUI;	and 2 months "overdose " and
    hospitalization.
4.  Why allow endless filings in domestic matter?   NO school/NO work, is this
    how probation works?  
5.  Did you notice how many children she tried to become parent to?
5.  Why didn't you enforce stipulated agreement on these matters?
6.  Why no PO reports like Angie Donahoo; 
7.  Why allow this kind of behavior, while on supervised probation!
8.  Why do you allow financial claims, knowing the mother holds the assets??

**Explain why Sean Kallery removed?  Didn't even care ?**
**How to justify DA conduct ?	Were you asleep?**
**Is everything defense counsel asks for is granted?**
You ignored so many warnings;  you failed to communicate any of this to victim.

NOTES: for phone call Benjamin Gutman (appeals)
-	must verify, exmaine.	
-	Anytime you do not risk something will slide by.   Def takes advantage that
  nobody checks.
-	See Parole  Officer memos from case I.
-	Not relevant to appeals, but must know what you are dealing with...
  divorce/custody cases:  behavior, judge's rulings, tenacious filings; conduct
  during probation
  Appears to enjoy legal process and knows some of process; unaffraid 

					
	
	

	
## 2023-07-20  "NULLITY"
x-Lawyer (retired) Jim ?? (prop 114 - gun control), met at Downtown Club, says:
    *	use affidavid (just what I told him)
    *	she's prison, probation violation etc.
    *	Nullity is NOT an appeal; it means it never should have happened in first place.
    *	Even though I was previously rejected under Civil Procedure, fraud, he
      said to submit it again.


## 2023-08-09 Municipal Court and Legal Dept  (unaware ALZ admitted)
Muni court seemed to have no info that ALZ admitted probation violation. Nor
did Legal Dept.   But Legal Dept took information, date of probation
revocation, case # and assured me that (1) DUI will still be prosecuted "we
have to" (2) will alert prosectutor (still  Nicole) but (3) it is up to
prosecutor to decide what to do; to get records; etc.

-   Use Salem Municipal Court:	503-588-6146 (main #)
-   For Legal Dept & records, same: 503-588-6003 (legal dept)
