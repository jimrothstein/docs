\section{Introduction}

I am one of the listed victims in 18CR66984.  I have appeared before this court before, in
person, by phone and in writing.

In April 2021, new charges were brought against the same defendant, ZIMMERMAN, Amy Lynn,  in Salem Municipal Court.  

However, that Salem court has an extensive backlog and the earliest possible
trial  date is the end of this year.   There is no next hearing date.
[^muni_telephone]

For this and possibly  other reasons, the District Attorney has moved that
probation be revoked.

This Court is considering how to proceed with these developments. 


As these issues work through the legal process, I request this Court consider:

1.	Move the Salem case to this court, to simplify, expedite and improve
		transparency.
2.	Extend the probationary period for this defendant.
3.	Reaffirm the "zero tolerance" criteria and "behavior change" goal as
		originally enunciated in this case.
4.	Release to public domain sufficient documentation for the Public to
		understand how, in practice, these standards are being met.


\section{Subpoena doesn't apply, besides it's a scam}


This case arose when DEF chose illegitimate and criminal means to thwart a legal proceeding,
a "scam" she called it. [^legitimate] 

Later, Defendant admitted guilt, was convicted and then entered a drug diversion program[^diversion] from which she graduated last year.


That process, from plea deal negotiations through to the present, involved
many government resources, interdisciplinary team of professionals and no
doubt many decisions.  It is almost entirely opaque.


Via public record, I have tried to follow this case.  Public records also
detail extensive litigation litigation by same Defendant.   Accordingly,
almost everything mentioned here is matter of public record.  You have much
information than I do.
[^disclaim]


\section{Recent Developments}

On March 4, 2021  Defendant graduated from Marion County Veterans' Court.[^MCVTC] \

	"The goal is to enhance public safety by stabilizing, habilitating[sic] and
	reintegrating dependence-free veterans back into our community utilizing
	federal and community resources."


	"The focus is on building supports for a balanced and healthy life. "

Some 12 days later, Tuesday, March 16, 2021 the Defendant allegedly was (1) 
DUI and (2) refused breath test. 

One month after graduation, early April 2021, the Defendant had a major medical event.[^major_medical]

On 5/5/21 DA motioned to revoke probation.

In September 2021, a Judgment in another case found Defendant "lack of
candor". [^candor]

In August 2022, that same judge found Defendant "abuse and attack" the other
party.[^abuse]

\subsection{New Actions}

My understanding of legal situation at this moment is:

-	Hearing to Revoke of Probation. [^Revocation]
-	Two new charges in Salem Municipal Court [^SalemMuni]


\subsection{Hearings}

This year I began listening to hearings[^listen_date].

If my notes are accurate: 

-	The probation case can not proceed until DA  confirms remote testimony from
	(former) Salem Police Officer is acceptable.  

-	This Court can not proceed otherwise until Municipal Court has ruled. 

-	At least two judges have referred to the current situation as "unusual" or
	"not normal", "long overdue" but reluctant to proceed with a "contested"
	case.

-	Twice I heard Defense Attorney say he contact District Attorney Braden
	Wolf and get "creative".  Twice I cringed.  

[^judges_said]


\subsection{No change here}


For the same set of facts, in the eyes of State of Oregon, I am both:

-	Crime Victim
-	Judgment Debtor [^ORCP71]

It can not be both.

Defendant's probation is scheduled to end in 6 months (Feb 2023) 36 months (vs 60 prior
felony conviction).   The DA asked for probation revocation almost a year and
half ago.


\section{What I see}

It is no secret I viewed  plea bargain as inappropriate for  the crime,
certainly inappropriate for the person.   Once I become aware that there is
no "right" to such leniency,  [^no_such_right] I protested.

Furthermore, from public records, once I saw clear deviations from "zero
tolerance" and "behavior change", I again reported and protested.
[^reported_to_court]

What I see is that the Defendant and circumstances have successfully brought this
Court to a standstill. 

Though Defendant  may *appear* to face significant legal difficulties, I have
heard that before.   

From the start you knew this would not be normal case. [^you_knew]


While legal process continues:


Accordingly, I ask the Court to, an immediate, but interim step:

1.	Move the Salem case to this court, to simplify and expedite. 
2.	Extend the probationary period for this defendant.[^afraid]
3.	Reaffirm the "zero tolerance" criteria and "behavior change" goal as
		originally enunciated in this case.
4.	Release to public domain sufficient documentation for the Public to what
		standards and criteria you are using and, in practice, how you are implementing
		these.


Exactly because this is not a 'normal' case I urge you to full disclosure.

But the main reason is prevention. From personal experience I know the
destruction this Defendant can do when abusing the legal process[^civil].  

For example, in any future formal, legal, financial  process based on merit and
truthfulness [^truthful], any of the parties will recognize the need for close scrutiny and
verification and be able to address the Court:


\begin{verbatim}

	Your honor, I know you will judge this issue based on facts and the
	appropriate law.  

	When preparing for this mattter, however,  I learned Def has
	previously made exorbiant claims (scams, extortion, depicted herself as  the
	victim) only to not show any evidence later.  You may check here, here and
	here.

	And Def has previously blocked real evidence, by dismissing valid
	subpoeona, denied police reports.  You may check here, here and here.

	Last, your honor, this Def has admitted to and been convicted of criminal
	activity to  circumvent a legal process. Here.


	I know you will use only the facts and the law, but I hope that you verify to
	your satisfaction that these are actual facts and appropriate any benefit of the
	doubt where it is deserved.

\end{verbatim}

	

This Defendant affects the lives of real people.  I ask the court to do no
less then what you said you would do.  Please do so expeditiously and without
more deals.

[^afraid]:  Expect the Defendant to contest, appeal, delay and make your work much
	harder.   But you must proceed. I want no contact with her.

[^no_such_right]:  Repeatably told Defendant had "right".  I can find no such "right."
SEE for example:  letter to District Attorney, 5 MAY 2020. \par
		ORS 135.886(1) "if it appears", "may propose" and especially (2)(h) "victim recommendation" \
		ORS 137.077 - pre-sentence report (not public) but *may* make available to victim. \
		"...before being considered for admission into MCVTC." (retrieved 8/31/22) \
		"...intervention program for qualified veterans..." \

 (c) fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; \par
Rule 71 - Relief from Judgment or Order, Or. R. Civ. P. 71 (“(C) Relief from judgment by other means. This rule does not limit the inherent power of a court to modify a judgment within a reasonable time, or the power of a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, or the power of a court to grant relief to a defendant under Rule 7(D)(6)(f), or the power of a court to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.”)

[^you_knew]:  1st prosecutor, Sean Kallery,  was brought in specifically to
	handle difficult cases or defendants.  That prosecutor also took the time to
	explain the reasoning behind the charges FILED and the charges NOT FILED.
	He said the standard to "behavior change", which I accepted.   He was aware
	of the DEF history. \par Among the items in  my notes:  if the Defense filed
	excessive motions or delays he might invoke Blakely to increase jail time.
