		conspiracy, "vulnerable", "nasty 3-yr divorce", "kind, flexible person" -
		highly credible, excellent people skills (sales, many accolates in
		Airbnb), those near her are intensely loyal - but if you 'cross' her, even
		criticize: then fearless, relentless attack, attack .....take no
		prisioners. - review Judge Hart's statement and Officer Gill > ## When
		will it stop? > - real, upfront costs (not future ...) - mother in
		jeapardy - confronted by overwhelming witnesses, documentation, evidence;
		with no one else to accuse; unified opposition ; no authority willing to

		Judical Judgement **18SC21468** - $55 (costs) + $125 (pre-party fee) +

		and regulations) or 90.510 (Statement of policy) (6) embodying the terms
		and conditions concerning the use and occupancy of a dwelling unit and
		premises. “Rental agreement” includes a lease. A rental agreement shall be
		either a week-to-week tenancy, month-to-month tenancy or fixed term
		tenancy. > ## 30 AUG 2018, misc thoughts> - claim: local law predominate
		over state (judge silent) - claim: assorted airbnb rules. at end, judge
		asked to read her papers re: airbnb and Salem laws I do not know what.
		Read in chambers. NOTE: decision relied upon. - judge did not seem to know
		law, landlord-tenant, did not know Airbnb. Why are her cherry-picked
		Airbnb rules in a court room? she somehow justified immediate eviction. I
		had the ToS in packet. - prior day, judge mentioned Traffic Court in
		Hillsboro (ppl more polite there, then here, he said) > ## Business

		Leah, Servpro, agreed to give statement, notarized; heard nothing from
		officer or Amy or ... - updated Officer JSHARP, a few text msgs, no
		response - James Heating, rec'd invoice (paid) noticed, PET, as in PET
		URINE; "PET" was erased on court copy! Gennie said what she sent today is
		what the tech wrote, "PET URINE" - Affordable Heating, spoke with Michael
		Oliver, not too helpful, tomorrow going on vacation (Salamon fishing),
		read him whole invoice. He said too "old" only has 30 day or less in
		front. Secretary keeps older. Won't give any information, privacy. First
		thought he said he would NOT charge. Then he thought already paid or too
		"old" Several times offered to show him directly. Asked about handwriting.
		Doesn't know anything about Servpro; does not want to get involved with
		sorting out handwriting.... so I think he (secy) may have original
		invoice. Court will have to ask him. - Empire Today - carpet cleaners.
		Ruben, kept putting me on whole to check with supervisor. Not sure if NO
		documentation at all or just can not tell me. Said ask court, ask Amy.
		Asked what do I owe? How much is estimate? What damage? Nothing. He did
		say address & name info did check. > ## R 6 SEP 2018> - DA:
		http://www.co.marion.or.us/DA/Pages/WhoWeAre.aspx - DA:
		http://www.co.marion.or.us/DA/Pages/investigators.aspx - 8-5pm, 555 Court,
		3rd floor, (503)588-5222 - investigator - EMAIL from Amy, "Justin" did the
		work and gave her 'Servpro' invoice - Who told Amy I am involved?? - To
		Bob: So, Amy’s attempts at collection are getting serious? Is that what
		you mean? Lies on top of Lies - it will not stop. That is what is getting
		serious. Collection? I'm clueless. I think, but do not know, that she must
		go to court AGAIN but this time re: paying. After that she can garnish,
		seize or whatever. (That's Calif; dunno Ore.) I want her arrested &
		prosecuted for fraud. That is object now. Unfortunately, when I went to
		the vendor Servpro - and showed the fake invoice, the office mgr Leah
		freaked out. She called Amy immediately and they talked. That was a big
		mistake, but I couldn't stop it. Worse, both manager (Leah)and Secretary
		(Melinda) knew Amy. The secretary (Melinda) EVEN stayed there in Airbnb!
		And may be a FRIEND of Amy. The manager Leah seems balanced and just wants
		to protect the company. But Melinda easily could be enenmy now. - 24/7
		Locksmith - see print - incorporated 6-7-2018 - Aaron - did Amy change
		date on a newer invoice?? Does she know Aaro - Call DA - must begin with
		either POLICE or PROBATION OFFICER (lv msg both) - Officer JSHARP off
		T,W,R 
		- Call Probation Officer (Angie Don... 503-434-7513) ; a little
		annoyed; said to go to police, only enforces supervision, doubted that DA
		would tell me to call her. apologized. - Sent DA letter 

		## F 7 SEP 2018> -
		DA response (quick!) go through police - Options? wait | draft letter to
		judge | lawyer | wait - police? maybe Sharp too busy, lower priority etc.
		dunno > ## Sa 8 SEP 2018> - trial audio - go thru ## Su 9 SEP 2018> -
		letter to judge > ## M 10 SEP 2018 - judge letter - still working - Keith
		Andreys, 2nd career, seems inteseted in case, but does not know many
		things. 503-584-1025 (see email) gives me name of Brian Orrio x-DA and
		call State FRaud line - need meds - Tues go to Tualatin (for 1 day?) -
		City of Salem, Bryce Bishop (m) 503-540-2399 - helped draft Salem's
		ST-Rental Ordinance (aka 5-17, report 5/8/17, section 14 - transient till
		29 days. - I call; he answers, listens, says receipts >30 days?

		Consumer Fraud, 877-877-9392 or website ## R 13 SEP 2018 - note to Brook
		Wood, esp on Avvo: - Be happy to keep you posted. Since the person was on
		probation for earlier felony, may be in for a long haul. fyi, for whatever
		it is worth ALSO filed complaint with Oregon, consumer fraud. I do not
		believe I am only 'victim' of fraud, given the accused's long record of
		civil suits, aggressive counterclaims, unsatisifed judgements to
		judgement-creditors, questionable land transfers to her mother, delinquent
		child support payments, 'indigent' claims (possibly SNAP food stamps)
		while running cash businesses and driving (mom's) Hummer, as well as
			formal complaints about judges, police officers. Good time for State
			examine some of the details to see if provable pattern (or just my
			layperson's imagination.) - And I won't let anyone forget a judge
			swallowed her arguments in total ("in toto" he said), while teaching me
			a "lesson" about not "crossing every i and dotting every t" and
			something about "oral" vs "written" agreements in Landlord-Tenant (not
			so , says guy who wrote City of Salem short-term housing ordiance.)
			Sorry, venting. But takes a talent to skirt along the edge of
			legal/illegal for such a long time. No one has time to shift through
			little details "in toto". - Call Byran Orrio, 503-313-0547 (16 yrs

			## T 9 OCT 2018 * Arraignment - Aumsville * DA = Katherine;
			Judge=WREN ************** * "I understand this case is about 1 set of
			facts; innocent till proven guilty. Enourage court to pay heed to Judge
			Hart's words: - "[Defendent]Amy is found to say and/or do anything to
			improve her circumstances, including manipulation of justice system."
			10/6/2016 IF Goal is Change Behavior: - Vigilent for what Judge Hart
			warned. Def is talented and can be persuasive; is determined, relentless
			and .... UNAFRAID. - Verify what I said: Study patterns because exist
			abundant factual information and sources. - Stop 'enablers' around her.
			- If Def alleges "scam", "victim", "harass", "get Amy Club" or attacks
			the Court itself, then - Decide True/False - If False, demonstrate to
			Def that this strategy is not risk-free, not cost-free. It is NOT A
			GAME. * Last, to leave on positive note, Def has the talent and CAN be
			and SHOULD be a force for good -- of course only she can realize this.
			Thank you. *********** 
			## W 10 OCT 2018 Dear Officer Sharp: I attained
			Zimmerman arraignment yesterday. Charges changed a bit from when you
			arrested her, so want to make sure we are on same page. DA said to
			contact you and ask you write "supplemental" report and deliver to SEAN
			KALLERY. - 6 SEPT 2018, her email to me, note: "JUSTIN" and that both
			Nicole and Leah (of Servpro) working on it. You interviewed Nicole and
			Leah on 8/31/2018; also both told me they KNEW Amy Zimmerman. Friend?
			Foe? - TRIAL PACKET: Empire Floor. Award for $710. (on audio) The
			document is for free estimate and is dated MAY 2017 (note tampered
			date). I was thrown out on JUNE 16, 2017. - Trial Packet: Affordable .
			Note Zimmerman writing on invoice referencing Serpro. Are you able to
			get ORIGINAL invoice from company? Was it paid? - Trial Packet: Libery
			Mutual. Court Award: $500. Note insurance payment to Zimmermans, less
			$500 deductible, due to me (on audio). I never contacted Liberty. Note
			involvement of mother and step-father. Insurance fraud? - Witnesses
			Olivia RUSSELL lived at house with 3 children (friend or cousin of
			Amy??). Audio tape, alleges that it was Olivia who instigated the
			eviction, called the police and then actually did it. (Zimmerman only
			'approved' it, by phone, sms?) Also allegations I was violent. But SMS
			messages from Zimmerman to me (at the time) tell a different version.
			And so do police reports. - Misc perjury Plenty on audio that is not
			true: things like business licenses, Airbnb contract (justification for
			evicition?), Oregon Liquor Control laws (why?) and things that still do
			NOT make sense to me, or I think just made up. - Possible to listen to
			the trial audio (with me) and together flip through both her trial
			documents and my trial documents to note major discreptancies. ## 23 OCT
			2018 - Sean Walter calls - little info - except DO NOT USE EMAIL,
			possible to "discover". Nothing from Office Sharp; nothing from Sean
			Kallery. - Meet 15 min before Grand Jury to (1) answer q (2) may want me
			to testify. - Date *was* November 6, but Officer Sharp can not attend.
			So Sean will notify. - Puzzled how all this works. Guess we are NOT
			going to really shift through evidence; charges remain at perjury,
			'impersonation' and attempted theft. Don't need 40 charges, but fear
			that even these will get widdled down, plea bargins etc. I think mother,
			insurance fraud, witness stories, should be included, esp if going to
			widdle it down, ie at least start with full deck. ## 26 OCT 2018 - Sean
			Walter - a few emails but really little info. Said DA already prepared,
			so seems like no interest (at this point) in what I have. I'm only to
			confirm what he has already decided to present (to Grand Jury). - High
			risk she will slip out of this/plea bargin to zip. I do not get a vote;
			still clueless about process. Kallery to give me 15' right before Grand
			Jury; otherwise I'm blocked and never heard from Sharp. - But they are
			the 'pros'. ## 09 NOV 2018 jim rothstein Fri, Nov 9, 2018 at 1:17 PM To:
			Sean Walter Hi Sean: Learned a lot last week - thank you and Sean - but
			here are few topics/questions where I am hazy. Can you point me in
			correct direction? --Documents Can I have copies (email is fine) of
			various indictments, plea bargain offer, etc.? List of 'victims'? --
			James Heating Is NOT included on the first arraignment (in October).
			This was invoice said "PET URINE" , which became " URINE" and defendant
			blamed me on civil trial audio tape. --Definitions Is a plea bargain a
			process, meaning subject to back-and-forth negotiations? Does plea
			bargain of "3 years" mean actually 365 x 3 days in prison? Does plea
			bargain mean pleading 'guilty' to ALL 7 GRAND JURY counts? Can plea
			bargain require defendant pay ALL debts to courts, criminal justice,
			probation fees? AND pay each vendor invoice? (ex: She did not pay James
			invoice; I did) Do I get a vote in any of these deliberations?
			--Subpoena Airbnb Why? Helps me. For you: invoices are false, the room
			in question was occupied by paying guest that very night; her story is
			nonsense. Helps me because defendant said she did not need to comply
			with a civil subpoena. --Probation Officer Can you introduce me to her
			PO; spoke to her by phone but very limited discussion. --Surprises You
			know I don't like these. Anything else you can tell me about? Thanks.
			jim ## ## 16NOV2018 - Annette, victim advocate in probation office.
			503-540-8041; geuinlly wants to help. But: (1) probabtion never gets
			involved in case till completely finished. (2) Zimmerman is handling by
			Yamhill County and it will stay there with any new crimes. - Annette
			says Angela Donahoo probably will want to talk to me then (explained
			that I have looseleafs of materials that may not rise to criminal, but i
			want PO to know). - Annette ALSO said to go over officer's head (to
			supervisor?) if officer not able to return calls. Seems like good idea.

			## 29 NOV 2018 - Call w/ Sean Walter, Victim's assist - PLEA - due
			Monday, Dec 3; maybe be 'set over' - DA can NOT object this; only judge
			can decide (can be any reason: need more time to talk to client, waiting
			for reports, ....) - PLEA - 'guilty' or 'non-guilty' - DA will not
				accept 'no contest' - PLEA DEAL - each time she rejects the old DEAL
				is removed and new one, less generous is offered. Thought I heard 5
				years? Sean W did not know. So I confused.d - NOT sure - what is next
				PLEA DEAL would be - FINES, FEES - yes, judge can impose; but court
				has NO TEETH to enforce; let up to Probabtion/Prorale officer to
				enforce, monthly payments etc. - RESTITUTION? can not be punitive (can
				be 'subjective') - so I have $45 for JAMES invoie - COURT seems UNABLE
				TO ENFORCE its own judgements: TELL JUDGE - 7 COUNTS, says he will fix
				records that say 6; servpro to be FELONY - NOTE: prosecutor DOES NOT
				contact defense; balll in defense court; but Sean says no
				communication, so expects Dec 3 will be 'set over' SHOULD SHE PLEAD
				guilty .... court will 'set over' 48 hours so victim can make a
				statement; she will then taken to jail immediately; no time to get
				tooth brush. ## 1 DEC 2018 SAT - Sgt Demmer -spoke with him; pretty
				much go thru officer on case: Joshua Sharp; did acknowledge Amy
				Zimmerman 'not most upstanding citizen' To appear at civil trial, use
				subpeona. - BUSINESS LICENSE, NO PERMITS - talk to City Attorney or
				City Permits, not police matter - SMS messages, Sept 6 email, copies
				from Airbnb (no longer on line), other WITNESSES go thru Sharp. ## Tue
				Jan 8 > - No plea to be entered tomorrow (why rush!) . Defendent
				asserting everyone hates her and needs trial. (4th hand info) - Next
				move: "status conference" with 2 lawyers & newly assigned judge
				(private) --- in couple of weeks. - If trial, 3 year prision is OFF
				the table; trial probably scheduled to begin in summer. - Sean W will
				pass on to Sean Kaller that statute of limitations for ORCP 71 is 1
				year. But I added not to let her use this date as negotiations; we
				will be whenever she is ready. - PO will not attend plea deal; not
				needed. > ## Wed Jan 9 2019> - Judge Mary James assigned:
				https://willamette.edu/law/faculty/profiles/james/index.html (seems to
				be lot of civil, as well as criminal) - example of civil work: oregon
				v oracle?
				https://www.markowitzherbold.com/channels/mhnew/Documents/Opinion-letter-from-Judge-James-state-v.-kate-brown.pdf
				> ## Fri Jan 11 2019> - Frm Ore Bar, spoke with **Wesley Garcia** at
				lenght. Listened carefully, checked online. But declined: - not sure
				he could "appear" in small to file overturn - I'd spend more money
				then gain - unlikely to have NEW trial for same LL-T issue -
				suggested, find lawyer who knows how to overturn small claims - other
				victims, didn't seem interested, - stressed judgement and collecting
				very different (i know) - argued it is MOTHER who has assets,
				fraudulent land transfes (didn't seem too interested), even though
				agreed with daughter has long record. - otherwise, seemed nice guy. >
				## Tue Jan 15 2019 ##> - called **Jeff Jones** again (503-588-2687) he
				took call; said he only does CRIMINAL DEF; seemed to say RESTITUION
				equal to and opposite amount should be easy way. Undo much harder,
				expensive. Doesn't know Sean Kallery, but seemed to think not big deal
				to use Restitution in this kind of case. - **Legal Aid Services** -NO
				- do not do this kind of LL-T; only refer people to Oreg Barn - Ore
				Bar, 3rd referral (but do not think they checked): **David Wallace**
				firm (971-287-0162). Johnny Hutchinson (?) called me right back,
				sounded ie (?) like eager youth,but DID have good ideas. - consider
				civil suit NOW, show invoices (DOG) erased; use DISCOVERY to get rest
				of financial documents. Didn't seem to buy my hestition that DA/police
				wouldn't like till criminal over. Didn't think I needed a conviction
				or plea to prevail in civil. - contingency: for accidents, malpractice
				... not this kind of thing. - \$1200 for him to file ORCP 71 (check
				this!) - multiple clients - no - will create conflict for lawyer, who
				to pay 1st?> ##Wed Jan 16 12:19:38 PST 2019> > 

				## Fri Feb 1 2019 17:28:01 PST 2019 next conference, trial, plea bargins> 
				- Still NO PLEA. - Next
				conference late March (20MAR). (3 year plea deal remains on table till
				then) 2-day trial on calendar for early April(8 APR19) She waived
				'speedy' trial in Oct/Nov. - Defense suggests it may file motions to
				challenge evidence. - DA warns will be "angry" if he must respond to
				meaningless motions; may invoke Blakely
				(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blakely_v._Washington), which sounds
				like increase jail time, despite Ore sentencing guidelines. -- My 2
				cents: I asked my contact why DA isn't angry now? - O/C= "out of
				custody" Her crime is non-violent property, not person; so not jailed.

		Sometimes thin line between civil & criminal (in general) and she can call
		Marion County DA to verify. Otherwise no info. Said she could listen to
		me; but then I said maybe I should not talke to you. Asked what is it I
		wanted; just to inform that there is public history. Would not give me
		name of lawyer, who she said also would not discuss ('privacy'). l/m with
		Sean, a few issues.> ## 21FEB 2019> call w/ Sean (or few days later) phone

		it in file? on CD? > ## Late Mar 2019 change 'advocates'> - spoke with
		Susanne (?) boss of advocates - nothing wrong with Sean Walter, just I may
		overload him. - case not difficult, but defendant is very difficult - she
		will assign another, who has bit more attention to detail. - Also spoke
		with annette - advocate who handles probation/parole - but only Marion, so
		not ALZ -- friendly but a bit busy. Helpful as she could. To start 2nd
		investigation (fraud in civil cases?) - go to police. > ## 08 MAY 2019 l/m
		Cheryl Thorson - new victim advocate - spoke at length W 15 May 2019; gave
		me numbef for Ore Victim's Crime... - repeated usual story; history .... -
		Will check with Sean K. Is confession on video? evidence? details? * 
		(20 JAN 2021 - VIDEO? still do not know status) - Will read police report -
		explained I notify civil court and want to be sure of my facts -
		Non-guilty probably done through her attorney, since status hearings are
		held in judge chambers and DEF not permitted. (didn't know this) 

		## 15 MAY 2019 Rochelle - Ore Victim's Crime Law Center - 503-208-8160 - non-profit?
		no fee? - have lawyers, do what DA can't, won't do; help with restitution
		(Ore does not enforce) - do not investigate (ie new crimes) - she will
		check ORCP 71 (fraud) can they do - fraud in civil case - it sounded
		unusual to her - she seemed helpful ## next day - calls back, spoke with
		lawyers, I should motion to postpone | set aside judgement till after
		completion of criminal trial; include : - indictments- grand jury , I am
		listed victim, and - any DA statement of charges. - does impact civil case
		- criminal case is moving foward Judge could "deny" and defendent could
		also ask for 'hearing' (but not likely b/c anything she says could be used
		in criminal court). > 

		## 20 MAY 2019 l/m Cheryl - questions? - Wouldl like
		to get motion to civil court out this week. - Ok to say exists confession?

		## 23 May 2019 Cheryl - returns call - dislike that 1 week goes by, have
		to call her 2 times before response, but ... - Sean Kaller out - reading
		file, nothing about confession; only says I did the damage and she has
		invoices which prove it. Big file. - She will check with Sean to see if
		more info. - I call her back: a bit worried; police office called me same
		day of arrest (Sept 11, 2018), my memory that she confessed to all, mother
		had nothing to do with it, officer reminded her that video this and
		charges serious; she just bushed it off, didn't appear too worried;
		altered invoices to avoid needing to call additional witnesses (what?!) -
		Also, you should have tWO police reports, including supplemental - yes? -
		I will hold off filing motion till get this straight, but running in
		statute of limitations - I filed civil lawsuit in early June 2018. - Call
		me Monday, either way? to give me update? ## 19 AUGUST 2019 l/m Cheryl ##
		26 NOV 2019 l/m Cheryl - got her, answering calls. - Will ask Sean if plea
		deal offered, is it 5 years? - Trial date, will it come up at Dec status
		conference? - Call her (or she'll call me) after status conference. - No
		other chnages in case. ## 18 DEC 2019 l/m Cheryl Today was status hearing.
		Results? trial date, plea offers, other info 
		## 23 DEC 2019 I call Cheryl;
		she answers Set over to Jan 15 2020. She may be eligible for "VETERANS
		COURT", who? what? Cheryl knows little, reads fromAA computer. VET COURT
		is still a criminal court, with some special accommodations related VET
		needs. Has special (military) advocate. Delay is to see if ALZ is eligible
		(service record, discharge etc). Judge ABAR used to handle all the VET
		cases, but he is re-assigned. Cheryl will ask Sean. Cherly can not find
		statute, says to Google for VET info. Discussion turnaround on calls. She
		says 24-48 hours. I gently say but you have met this, I do keep records.
		She promises to get back to me, one way or other by end of year. ALZ
		military records to remain private. Police officer expected back in
		spring. 
		ORS 135.881 - diversion? ORS 137.077 - pre-sentence report (not
		public) but *may* make available to victim. 
		ORS 137.090 -court "shall
		consider" .. mitigate, aggravate ..situations that include military; can
		not figure out more.

		find info. * 


		## 26 DEC 2019 Cherly calls, lvs msg Very quick. Sean not
		sure what his stategy is. Wait to see what happens. He stays as prosecutor
		and her current lawyer remains as defense. Sounds like VET court is some
		kind of "diversion". If elible, she enters will a plea (guilty ??) and if
		she breaks any of rules, then bad things happen, I guess. I lv msg for
		Cheryl thanking her very, very much. Checked online ... little vet court
		info. Sounds like really vet TREATMENT courrt, ie drugs, mental health
		involved with non-violent crime. Not clear to me at all. 

		## 17 JAN 2020
		VET court, Cheryl victim's assistance> AlZ IS ELIGIBLE for **VET COURT**
		records=private. Must plead guilty, follow all rules (minder is appointed
		?). NO JAIL TIME. If break rule, can get kicked out of VET COURT and
		return to regular criminal court. DEF lawyer tryhing to convince AlZ to
		take it. Court granted ANOTHER extenstio, 2 weeks to Jan 27 (?), 2020. ALZ
		wants day in court, denies guilt. Sean (DA) has some influence in VET
		Court, but better to say we gave her every possible chance and all
		options. Sean suprised about VET Court, usually these things are
		established very early on. Police - return May/June. Stipulated agreements
		("plea bargin") - new law reduces DA power; in Ore. judge eecides . Sean
		said 3 year offer still on table (I said was told that IF she rejected the
		first offer, and she'd be foolish not to, the offer goes to 5 years. Each
		time he has to "do more work" the offer gets harsher. Well, does not seem
		to be way it works now, especially since Judge, not DA, sets an agreement.
		Note entirely poossible for judge to say "6 months" is enough or whatever.
		Next: late January hearing. Cheryl is being more helpful now.> ## 26 JAN
		2020 - Ore Crime Law - Spoke with Taylor - (see 15 May also) How to get
		civil court to respond if Def takes VET Court and pleads guilty? She calls
		back: Ask DA to write letter, present to judge by first asking clerk.
		(Forgot to tell her DA refuesed to write letter.) ## 30 JAN 2020 - l/m
		Cheryl, ALZ hearing yesterday? ## 3 FEB 2010 - Cheryl, next appearance: 12
		FEB Left 3 phone calls for Cheryl. Never called back. Today, Monday at
		noon, I call again and got Cheryl. Reading from computer, she says 29 JAN
		hearing was in JAMES' court; Def asked to obs VET Court 06 FEB ALZ will
		'observe' VET Court which is now handled by JUDGE Daneil WREN 12 FEB ALZ
		will appear JAMES' court to give answer on VET: yes or no. However this is
		NOT a drop-dead date. I asked Cheryl to ask Sean: why the hesitation?
		Seems like no jail is pretty good deal. She already has felony, what is
		down side? Ask Sean. ## T 18 FEB 2020 - x-probation officer, Angie Donahoo
		she spoke to me. Marion County to take over; probation file in transit;
		Probation had been **by mail** . She will now probably have closer
		supervision. Ackowledged: twice, in writing, said 'not benefiting' from
		probation; judge makes decision. Added that problem may be mental health
		and she, hopefully, will now get help she needs. Told her I am not only
		victim, plenty of civil suits against her; doubt she never forged or lied
		before in court. Anige's advice best I can do: talk to Victim's
		Assistance! (told her always 2 steps wrong, behind.) Cheryl - l/m 

		## W 19
		FEB 2020 - Ore Victim Rights, Cheryl Ore. Victim Rights (in PDX), pro bono
		ONLY, mostly help with contested restaining orders, violation of victim
		rights (esp violent crimes). Taylor took my info; may contact DA re: why
		didn't new prosecutor contat me before plea offer. Cheryl - I call; no one
		responded yet, no info yet. Ask if she could politely, BANG on door of
		various prosectutors. ## F 20 FEB 2020 - Cheryl-last call; DA Uggh. Have
		called Cheryl everday this week. Nothing. I mean nothng since sketcy info
		first day. No call back from DA Wolf (1 week ago). Sense: DA is done with
		case. Moved on. Detials, why, who .. irelevant to them now. Call Cheryl
		about 4:15 pm - get her. Nothing. She has **N O T H I N G**. "Gone in the
		Wind", referring to people she's tried to reach. I read riot act: - Will
		attend ALZ hearing next week. - Will come to their office. Wait until I
		have all documents (police, plea deals, copy of whatever judge signed with
		'guilty' plea. Will wait until I have info. Or you call police. Once have
		everything, will take across street and ask to deliver to judge (think I
		can do this) and give judge everything. Anything you guys do NOT give me I
		will tell that to judge. Nothing more improtant right now. Been working on
		this 1 1/2 years, but 1 year beofre that. Will raise hell. She says "OK,
		ok" Few minutes later, she l/m that Wolf is about to call me. (I don't see
		any voice msg.) Cheryl is 'fired.' Not going to deal her. ## R 27 FEB
		2020, Salem, VET court, file to reverse civil, DA, Cascade Coll Bus to
		Salem. File motion and order **to reverse civil, seek damages.** (2
		pages). * 2 MAR 20 (see courthouse computer) "DENIED This case already
		went to * contested trial. Prior judgment remains in effect." Judge Manuel
		Perez. Listen in Veteran's Treatment Court (3 min, till thrown out - Judge
		sick, this is meeting, not court - private) Parole Officer inside; wait
		till done -- waste of time Marcelina Ascencio-Bartista (503-540-8031)and
		program boss (see handwritten notes). Then spoke with boss. Think got the
		msg that I'm pissed. These 2 are waste of time, not even familar with
		case, def past. Vet is DRUG treatment - bull. PO Marcelina is useless.
		Every Q answered by referring me to Correction's Victim Adv/ DA plus long
		speeches instead of "I can't answer". Repeat, loop. Clearly she knows
		nothing about ALZ. Her boss, also clearly unfamlar with ALZ and games,
		claims HIGH SUCCESS Rate of Vet. ZERO info. Eventually realize this Vet's
		Court is all about drugs, little to do with criminal. Seem to BEND OVER
		backwards to help people (good). I see one guy is really trying. But they
		do point out rules to him and try to defuse passions. Except ALZ will take
			full advantage of this! Speak with DA, Brendan - "not on his calendar"
			(sorry, not leaving) He does speak. Says he did return my call ?? Think
			got msg that sentence is too light if goal is "behavior change" and I
			have damages. Visit Lorie Roberts, owner of Cascade Collections,
			plaintiff and knows family. Stick to public info -- see handwritten
			notes. (503) 364-0455 


			## F 28 FEB 2020 -- spoke with Kristy Winther
			credit concepts (see FEB 2019); said she would call me back but didn't.

			*** ## M 01 MAR 2020 Spoke with Annette (Victim's Advocate -- yeah, well
			maybe criminal's advocate, too). She was very nice. Understood my
			concerns and rights (seek overturn, see damages, not only victim, and
			HEARD ALL THIS BEFORE.) Explained tried to talk with parole officer
			(Marcella) and boss, but did not go well - my job is not to be liked.
			She said happy with incremental change, only def can decide to make real
			change. So I repeated again, I have judgment against me + damages. So
			can not go away (She did try to collect). I made it clear I see no
			acceptance of responsibility on her part and thought plea extremely
			light given the history(I was not part of it and was originally told
			purpose "behavior change" (Sean DA). Their definition of 'progress'
			quite different from mine, I understand, as human. She said she
			understood and assured me I had rights. ## T 17 MAR 2020 - Janice, Salem
			DA Victim RESTITUTION, my summary. Civil DENIED. -for RESTITUTION, see
			email and ~~handwritten notes~~. * ONLY for expenses (travel, lost wages
			due to subpoena; hard financial losses, ie stole laptop; covers all
			counts including dismissed.) * NOT ALLOWED for Restitution: * pain &
			suffering * expenses (except related to subpoena, but I was pd for grand
			jury) * investigations (state should do; so nothing for copies made to
			police etc.) * * travel to Salem, court house, etc b/c voluntary * civil
			cases - nope; costs to undo civil - no. use civil court for
			damages/recover costs. * recover debt from judgment-debtor ; nope, not
			hard loss. * Defamation -no. * Attempted theft - no. She didn't get it!
			* interest - no. * * Restitution procedure. * Timetable. * Def has right
			to review/contest. * Judge holds hearing. Decides. -for civil DENIAL:
			Last month a Landlord plead guilty to 6 felonies related to a earlier
			civil case (perjury, forgery, id theft). In that case, based on this
			fraud, the LL won her counter-claim and I, the tenant, lost my original
			claim. I am now crime 'victim' or "judgement debtor" depending how you
			view this. Earlier this month the civil court DENIED my motion (ORCP 71)
			to reverse the ruling against me. And the DA insists RESTITUTION can not
			include anything from the civil case. I was not consulted in
			negotiations for plea deal. Where do I go from here? ## W 25 MAR 2020 -
			Janice, Salem DA Victim RESTITUTION I call. Got Janice at home (corona
			virus). Restitution. Braden agreed with what she told me (only hard
			losses). Hearing 12MAR, just official approval to enter VETERAN's court.
			VET Court and Drug Court are different specialty. She must meet with
			judge at least 1x per month (that's all?) I exlained: can not stand that
			I am both "victim" and "judgement debtor" and I will be become a thorn,
			nusiance, irritant, disliked. But I can not go away. (Not a threat of
			any sort.) Though again expressd displeasure with plea deal and that
			Braden seemed to understand/not disagree on 27FEB mtg. ## T 31 MAR 2020
			- l/m Braden Wolf Repeating that I am in "HOT SEAT" Civil Count denied
			motion to undo. Civil lawyers tell me to put it in plea deal; didn't. We
			spoke about this. So as courtesy start w/ you and Sean Kallery. I can
			not go away. The situation can not stand (she did try to collect prior
			to arrest.) I need your help. ## T 7 APR 2020 - janice l/m
			(restitution?) sean kallery l/m (help! ) At some point: Douglass,
			Shannon becomes ALZ lawyer, "retained" or as public defender, not clear
			to me. On this day, motion to Amend (for restitution). ## 17 APR 2020 -
			Amendment , adds Restitution. Not restitution: Audio of Civil Case ($9),
			postage to civil ct (LL-LT) re: criminal; cost to fix and recover SMS
			from my old (damaged) phone ($100), laptop - open and deleted all files
			($??); Civil - cost of subpeona , police records, postage, copies made
			and sent to Off Sharp; lawyer fees for civil -- NONE are restitution. ##
			W 22 APR 2020 - Annette, Victim's Advocate (Parole/Probabtion) Office in
			'constant contact' with Def. What does this mean? 1 phone call per week.
			(this is during covid-19 virus epidemic). Annette has little information
			re:compliance, payment (to court) etc. Some things going on with Parole
			Officce, but protected by HIPPA. [Crime DOES pay.] Suggests DA for
			additional information re: compliance, payments etc. ## W 23 APR 2020 -
			janice Ugggh. 57' minutes on phone. Nothing. (She never did contact me
			re: restition) but apparently did go through and was ordered by court
			(4/17/20), $45. As to 'child visitation' crime (listed on police
			report), I s/d call the police office. Ten min later seems that DA did
			get a copy .... and ??? Same with Def Compliance, fee schedule (Call
			Court Acctg 503-588-5601), then NO if you want pay plan: Braden. Ditto
			if want to know last Hearing info. Everything seems to go to Braden. But
				she is doing her best to get me all the answers, if she can
				(bullshit). What are the rules? I want to know everything, till you
				give me statute why I can't. Grand jury, criminal record (back to age
				10) -- it is juvenile she says; then why do I know it involved a bus??
				Back and forth, waste time, something NOT her job duty, but says she
				is willing to do. All nonsense. Get nothing. Let her know nobody
				returns calls. Write a ltter to Paige Clarkson -- good idea. ## M 27
				APR 2020 - court acctg, balance = $911 (for this case, owes court) --
				do not charge interest, but (503-588-5601 - Marion Court acctg office)
					-- court adds 1 time $200 assessment, if not paid in 28 days (but
					not done yet for this case? covid?) -- eventually turned over to
					collection -- nothing State does for repeat (non-payment) offenders,
					but might affect probation. -- to get TOTAL owes court (all cases)
					would need to run report (I said not to) * Unrelated? 29apr2020
					payment for 15DR case, $25 by "Lynn Stevens" 2020-20874-TP (so many
					waivers!) ## T 19 MAY - Annette, nice, but can release no info -
					Annette works mosty with victims of domestic violence, sexual
					assult. 100s of people or more. - Told Annette re: Amy Lynn Z too
					little, too late. Should have been done when she was 10 years old.
					Incremental changes are good. But may not be enough. As victim, my
					rights limited to saftely. - She kept saying she hopes I get
					"answers." Told her, no the purpose is incomplete prosectution. Def
					is threat to society. And DA not returning my calls. So writing
					letter to full DA; Annette said she understood.> ## R 21 MAY --
					janice of victim's calls, Wolf will call tomorrow. - guess Annette
					called to victim's hahaha. - this is garbage. 1 month to get back to
					me!?! - return her call; happy to listen; but too little, too late.
					I think you guys need to re-examine prosecution of Def. - Friday,
					22MAY - no phone call, no message. Disappointed? yes Surprised? no,
					not really. They don't care. -Tuesday 26 MAY 2020, Mr. Wolf calls,
					l/m, says Victim's Assist have answered my questions, but he can
					answer them as well. Will get back to me at later date. I send FAX
					below: ## DRAFT 26 MAYd 2020 25 MAY 2020 CASE: 18CR66984 ZIMMERMAN,
					AMY LYNN ===================================== Dear District
					Attorney Clarkson: I write to ask you to review the above case and
					defendant. Some of reasons include: The objective of prosecuting
					this defendant, as Sean Kallery told me , was to effect "behavior
					change." I considered this an acceptable and reasonable goal. He
					assured me he was assigned to the "tougher "cases. However, even as
					written, the plea deal appears to be excessively lenient; I do not
					know why. Things like frequent drug screenings and the like, however
					irritating to the defendant, seem doubtful to effect "behavior
					change." Moreover, in practice, the arrangement seems like more of
					the same from the failed, first probation. Despite the ominous
					description offered by your attorneys and staff, I think the real
					question is why didn't you do any of this with the first, failed
					probation. Why do think more of the same will do anything? I
					requested access to the all the case evidence and documents, but I
					have only an incomplete police report. Nonetheless, available public
					records leave patterns, raise questions and reveal warnings about
					this defendant. I make no accusation, but do you believe I am the
					only criminal victim? The defendant's has admitted to perjury,
					forgery and the like. But to laypeople, the real takeaway is that
					she and her co-defendant (civil) fooled a senior judge and abused
					the legal process. The line between civil and criminal does not
					appear to be as fixed as the law books may say. As a consequence,
					for the same set of facts occurring at the same point in time, I am
						simultaneously : - crime victim, and - judgement debtor This makes
						no sense: your lawyers say it "civil" but the civil lawyers say
						correction belongs in the plea deal. Accordingly, I have also told
						your lawyers I can not "go away" until this is corrected. Where
						else would you like me to go? So I request that you take another
							look at this defendant, her history, any enablers or other
							relevant information. Until we see "behavior change" and
							defendant takes responsibility for her own actions, the job is
							not done and courts and public remain at risk. Thank you for
							your time and efforts. Jim Rothstein 831-824-4304 

							## 26 MAY 2020
							l/m Lori, Cascade Collections q/m on voice; pass on some info:
							-noticed LL/T case; Is ALZ back in landlord business, ie income
							-also mother making payments on court balance; so is mom another
							source of income? -I am asking DA to re-open case; not done
							right or fully 1st time. -"incremental change" seems to be
							objective now, which is NOT ample. -ask about Lori's case with
							ALZ, posponed again, till summer; but note: the LL/T case was
							not posponed. 

							## 26 MAY 2020, fax/ email to to DA: Paige
							Clarkson - she replied right away, by email. - All is fine. they

							## Misc. FACTS, ALZ, Notes, *

							Pres, Ashely added to filing (early April 2020) * Recall May 20,

							August 19. 19SC51694. * Last time, probation office wrote
							reports; any deviation from requirements; this time? 

							## 12AUG2020; call with Annette: * ALZ no contact with partner.
							(why?) - in compliance; no details b/c HIPPA; - Stable;
							treatment "going well". But .... anything you can say that is
							NOT covered by HIPPA? (vague) - employed? PO has latitude , now
							want her focused on treatment. - no payments? judgements are for
							50 years (check this); may have been turned over to Dept of
							Revenue (check!) * Alexa's law, change in ownership (to mother,
							daughter) - no info. * Civil case * next week (will tell PO
							Marcelina Ascension-Batista ...); sounds like did not know. I
							said this will report card on how well you are doing....
							Remember you must verify independently every statement. *
							Annette thinks I'm frustrated. Well, yes, State needs to dot
							every i, cross every t. (like judge told me!) Don't think you
							are doing that. and you give only vague answers. I want to
							check. This is between State and ALZ, don't try to say somehow
							bet. me and ALZ; that part is over. * Claim: team watches every
							week: Judge Wren (2x per month); DA (really??); PO marcelina ,
							Providers (who?), Court Supervisor. 

							## 13AUG2020 calls to acct,
							records, Child Support - NEXT: Call Tammy (Supervisor) knows
							rules best. - Payments to date? Scant, nothing since April or
							May. - On 5-case payment plan. Details??? Because Def went on
							"treatment", case recalled from COLLECTION (private?). 

							- Understood little of what this person said. Call Tammy Monday. 
							- can write judge letter if I think not indigent. - 50-year rule.
							Never heard. There is 20-year rule, but can not give me any
							reference or what this applies to . 

							-	Records: a bit more helpful, but they must go through every since case to get
							balance. Forget this. For 15DR case, owes court $607.44,
							judgements over $1000 for child support (but has no info on
							actual payments -- call Div of Child Services). I asked what you
							would do if DA called and asked what does this person owe?
							Laugh, DA never calls us. * Child Services: (800-850-0228) hung
							up on me. Said they are enforcement, yep what I want. Said I was
							not party. But guy sounds like total jerk. said I need to "call
							someone else!"! * from courthouse computer: * 3/27/20 ALZ
							motion: drop stalking order?? Demands on parenting; sounds *
							like cut ALZ off from Alexa?? ALZ wants to drop support

							10/6/20 - Hart denies ALZ request to enforce parenting, judge
							writes more like modification and denies. (If ALZ has time to
							write all of this, then why not work?) *** 

							## 17AUG2020 call to acctg; msg to Annette - spoke with Tammy (supervisor at acctg).
							ALZ agreed to payment plan, for 5 cases. Plan itself (document)
							is private. - Last payment was Mar 2020; were it not for
							Covid-19 case would be turned over to Collection; it is
							delinquent. - Collection means assigned to one of private firms
							contracted by State of Ore. Proceeds ARE returned to court LESS
							a fee that firm is entitled to. Firm does not keep money
							collected. Private firm can garnish wages, use legal tools, that
							court does not resources to do. - Covid-19; hold on turning any
							cases to Collection, until at least Sept. (State determines.) -
							Money from mother; Court takes money from anyone, does not bind
							that individual as source of assets to defendent. - Delinquent?
							Is this a probation violation? - Other civil cases? That is not
							money owed to court. - Change in financial condition? Yes, they
							determine in-house, but said I should ask a lawyer, since it is
							a legal question. - Left msg with Annette: acct delinquent,
							violation? what are you doing about it? Something she agreed to
							(the plan) and immediately backed off. 

							## 23 SEPT 2020 ; notes
							from Courthouse computer: 9/22/20 - ALZ pays $1.50 + $125.00,

							## 20 OCT 2020 **Accounting, Court
							Payments, Clerk Court Acctg 503-588-5601** -- ask for Tammy
							(supervisor) , appears that a waver $56? was error and will
							removed. Also, If feel suspect not indigent or lying or .....,

							being fooled. That is why is able to defraud so many people and
							get away with it. * City of Salem Rules ... rental without
							proper license. No change at all! 


							## 6 OCT 2020 call to Annette,
							she is deflecting, not being helpful. * Annette says in
							'compliance' per last court visit. However, Annette seemed *
							completely unaware of my references to court cases indicating
							that maybe not all is well. * Annette increasingly hiding
							behind: privacy, don't have access to that (it is PUBLIC
							RECORD), only need to tell you re: safety; SAYING: go to DA or
							PO Marcelina . Keeps playing dumb, or not her job. Ok, stop
							bothering Annette, no longer helpful in any way. Definitely not
							on top of the case. And I told her that. * Examples: have you
							been to house (like CW's parole officer), brings up covid. ALZ
							has income, tenant.. thinks ALZ is unemployed. Associating with
							criminals CW ... can't talk about CW because another case
							(talking about ALZ). Associating with crminals CW; says in
							living in half-way house going to happen (I say this ALZ's
							house.) * Annette at one point does say ALZ unemployed (so they
							think). * Annette - don't waste time (or make enemies). She
							wants to play dumb, not her job.... Don't push it. * Call PO
							Marcelina, be nice, inform - DON'T ARGUE; then send letter to
							DA. All you can do. 

							## 8 OCT 2020 call DA, victim assistance *
							Said to call parole, do not know what PO Marcelina can or can
							discuss. Once case closed, DA has nothing to do with it. Give me
							main number for parole, probation --- but is Annette's number!

							## 9 OCT 2020 State: Board of Parole and Probation. Ms. Robin
							Mas... * Listened, but did not have much info or suggestions.
							Her area is people leaving prison on parole. * ALZ is under
							supervision of Court, Marion County; so very different. 

							## 16 OCT 2020 **20CN04196** ALZ seeks contempt against Timindra *
							Edgar Diaz, retained by ALZ. * 12/12/20 DENIED - Court finds
							Timindra NOT in contempt. Guess Timindra stopped responding to
							ALZ's demands or whatever or child demands. * Lynn
							Zimmerman-Stevens is now serving papers on Timindra! 

							## 23 OCT 2020 l/m at VA - re: Vet Treatment - how to get basic statistics
							* Melissa Miller, Marion County, co-ord, 503-584-7741 * Mellisa
							Parker ??? 503-584-8031 * Peggy Kuhn, VA, VJO mobile:
							503-757-3174 (Didn't work: 503-220-8262, x 33839) ## 26 OCT 2020
							spoke w/ Offr Romano (fem) at Salem - Code Enforcement
							(503-540-2488) but best to go through complaint process
							(503-588-6421) - friendly, she & police know property well and
							ALZ. Often drives by, just to check. - History,lots, available
							by subpeona only. Last check (per my complaint?) checked shed
							and trailer ... no signs of living there. Couple small code
							issues that ALZ did fix. - Explained that I am victim; I lived
							there; ALZ committed felonies (unafraid to perjure and forge
							documents -- not 'trust but verify' check 1st; Offr Romano
							seemed very on-top of it. - Discussed petitions to raise
							children from other marriages; no-contact orders with spouses;
							yelling with baby in arm per witness - tenant. Maybe an
							excellent mother, but I check to be sure no lies on custody
							documents. Explained I feel she got off extremely easy and
							probabtion has not even visited -- ripe for more abuse. Courts
							should subpeona. 

							## **20DR17099** (10/6/20) ALZ v CW,
							Separation, seeks no contact order. * Marriage 2/19/19 ! Marion,
