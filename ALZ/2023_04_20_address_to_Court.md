Statement to Court (via phone)

Almost 2 years since prosectutor sought to revoke probation.  Three reasons were given:
-   DUI
-   failure to obey laws
-   not benefiting from probation

Each hearing since has been set over, and I hear unusual this case is, how lawyers want to be "creative" (it is a stipulated sentence, there is no "creative") and nobody wants to have "contested" hearing.

And it has 4 1/2 years since the original prosectutor told me the purpose of this entire exercise was "behavior change".   He felt a jail was term was both necessary and required.

However, this route was not taken and we are still here today.
