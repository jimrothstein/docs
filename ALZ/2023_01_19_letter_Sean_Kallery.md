Dear Mr. Kallery:

You may remember prosecuting this 2018 case for perjury, forgery, identify theft
that occurred in a civil case, under oath.

You explained that you often handled the more difficult cases or defendants.
When you spoke to me, you seemed aware of defendant's litigation, probation
history and felt that "behavior change" was appropriate and necessary.

After the defendant rejected your plea deal offer, there was a long delay
while the arresting police officer was on active military duty.  

When the case resumed,  under a new prosecutor,  the defendant was allowed to 
enter a diversion program.  (I never found documentation that defendant has a 
"right" to this.)

Fast forward to May 2021 and the prosecutor filed motion to revoke probation
following a DUI/breath test refusal.  This matter remains unresolved because
there is backlog of trials in Salem Municipal Court.

During 2022, I listened to several Marion Court hearings on this case.   There 
seemed to a pattern:   after the judge and all parties reiterated how unusual
this case was,  I then would cringe as the Defendant's attorney promised to 
work toward a "creative" solution. Each time the case was then set over. 

The next hearing date is set for 17 FEB 2023, some 4 days AFTER probation was 
due to end (13 FEB 2023).


I write because there is abundant public evidence how the Defendant has used
her probation time.   

If you look at **15DR14800**, which began before this case and probably will
continue after,  you see written judgments from Judge Hart of  "lack of
candor", or "strong circumstantial evidence was presented that Amy [Zimmerman]
overdose on a controlled substance in April 2021." (both 28 SEP 2021).


Less than 6 months ago, Judge Hart concluded:

    "Amy [ Zimmerman] has continued to emotionally, mentally and
    psychologically abuse and attack Timindra [x-spouse] through unwarrented
    court filings and hearings."   (3 AUG 2022)

This is in addition to the record you viewed back in 2018.

I have made my own position to the Court clear.   However, I am not sure
the Court and professionals involved find this probation behavior
acceptable or just do not care. 

The diversion's own Mission Statement:

    "The Marion County Veterans Treatment Court (MCVTC) works to identify 
    veterans within the criminal justice system and honor their service by 
    providing a collaborative, judicially supervised, mentor oriented, 
    treatment regime. The goal is to enhance public safety by stabilizing, 
    habilitating and reintegrating dependence-free veterans back into our 
    community utilizing federal and community resources."

    "The focus is on building supports for a balanced and healthy life. "

I understand the State may only prosecute for specific crimes (DUI, forgery 
...), but to outsiders the Defendant's repeated pattern of abuse of the legal 
system for what she can not obtain lawfully needs to end.

   
Thank you.
