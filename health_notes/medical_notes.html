<p>8 JAN 2020</p>
<p>Dear Dr Wong:</p>
<p>Just spoke with Dr.&nbsp;Wei Wang (I’ll call him Dr.&nbsp;Harbin - since that is hometown in China), who has a slightly different take on situation (hyperoxaluria + high fecal fat + low elease-1).</p>
<p>Has seen one patient with Pancreatic Insufficiency AND Bacteria overgrowth - said very <em>rare</em>.</p>
<p>Does not suspect chronic pancreatitis as a cause of fat high fecal fat or fat malabsorption, nor cancer or tumor.</p>
<p>Suspects low elease-1 may be FALSE, often diluted.</p>
<p>Felt PERT enzyme trial might give information, but he felt MRI could be more definitive as to pancreas health, at least to rule things out. Felt no indication for biopsy, an argument in favor of EUS (via mouth).</p>
<p>So we agreed on MRI. I believe he put the order in.</p>
<p>I would like Dr.&nbsp;Wang (“Dr Harbin”) to stay in picture. He has some clinical experience with bacteria overgrowth and hyperoxaluria and generally seemed to be aware of some of the issues involved.</p>
<p>What do you think? jim &gt;</p>

<p>(added 19APRIL2021) * Two cause hypothesis: fat malabsorption and bacteria in abdomen * Referral for hernia eval (rejected … not coverd) * Referral for EUS eval (this became NMR for pancreas) * Encourages enzyme approach; but I am skeptical that too few other symptoms. * Claims “success” means fecal fat drops by 1/2 (not just 10-20%).

<p>Here are your test results per Dr.&nbsp;Wang:</p>
<p>MRI revealed multiple pancreatic cysts with pancreatic atrophy.</p>
<p>There was no evidence of pancreatic mass.</p>
<p>The findings are consistent with pancreatic insufficiency. -A little suprising!<br>
(1) Thought he did not think PI or pancreatitis. (2) Cause??? Gallbladder stones? Blockage? (3) Why non-standard symtoms.</p>
<p>TWO problems: -pancreas health, don’t let it get worse. -probably PI, fat malabsoprtion, start enzyme trial to see if oxalate drops?</p>
<p>ALSO, Dr.&nbsp;Mikay - every 6 months: kidney function and urine protein. sync with Litholink! (2 per year)</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mar-2020-mri-dr.-wei-wangpancreas">4 MAR 2020 – MRI, Dr.&nbsp;Wei Wang(pancreas)</h2>
<p>-Begin Zenpep; see if reduces stool fat (to normal) and if urine oxalate (to normal). Esp if oxalate does not, revisit to see what is benefit of medicine.</p>
<p>-Details: Dr.&nbsp;Wang (pancreas) is cancer doctor and best to use email, not telephone appts since his patients need this. OK. Followup w/ endocrinologist or other Dr.&nbsp;Wang (GI) or email. Several times said oxalate, calcium are beyond his expertise. I do have FAT MALABSORPTION, PANCREAS INSUFFICIENCY and normal path is enzymes, followed by monitoring, repeat MRI in a year or so.</p>
<p>-Pancreas has 20-30 or more cysts and large. Maybe born this way; maybe had pancreatitis and that caused it (no pancreatitis now), maybe genetic (talk to family). 10% of population have a (one) cyst, this many is relatively rare. Has NO name. Will pancreas live another 10-20 years, yes. The cysts become large (size?) have squeezed the normal pancreas cells, compromising their function; not reversible. Severe atrophy. Shrunk available pancreas area.</p>
<p>-Cancer? No guarantees, but from MRI, which was right thing to do, these type of cysts usually benign. Redo MRI every other year to monitor. Can also remove pancreas! OR can have EUS through mouth to get biopsy. Monitoring or biopsy - he is neural.</p>
<p>-Zenpep. Should expect to gain weight (since fat remains in body); stool change. Reduced stool fat (to normal?) ; he hedged.</p>
<p>-Hyperoxaluria. Beyond his expertise. Period. Maybe another factor. All he is doing to studying pancreas and above is recommended procedure, information. (My ‘theory’ if fat gets absorbed, normally, then fat won’t bind with Calcium on way to colon. Such Ca free to find with Ox.)</p>
<p>-Why no symptoms? Maybe my body got used it. So I asked what do we expect to happen? What is benefit? If no benefit, why continue with medicine? Ambiguous, but he understood.</p>
<p>-NEXT: start Zenpep; may need to adjust dose.&gt;</p>

<p><strong>“Theories”</strong> Enteric Hyperoxaluria due to (1) Fat Malabsoption or (2) bacteria hangover or (3) some other factor. Nobody knows.</p>

<p><strong>Need Discussion</strong> Litholink !! before/after trial Kidney Health! Many questions. Explain fat malabsorpton - no symptoms. Explain high PTH. Lupus antibodies? Prescriptons - review, decrease med? Abdominal hernia: problem since summer 2019. MRI - other organs? Pancreas - health, MRI everyother year.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="jun-2020-new-primary-care---interview">2 JUN 2020 New Primary Care - interview?</h2>
<p>I am considering a change in Primary Care Physician and would like to talk with you, if you feel there might be a fit.</p>
<p>For my age (64), I am relatively healthy and try to follow the usual diet/exercise advice, plus regular health monitoring. Most of the issues I have appear to be well controlled, stable and not much of an issue.</p>
<p>One issue is not controlled: Hyperoxalura (high urine oxalate), and the associate risk for kidney stones and kidney function. There is still no confirmed diagnosis, and though fat malaborption is possible, there is also evidence more than 1 factor is at play.</p>
<p>I am not seeking an expert in hyperoxaluria, there are too few of these. Nor do I seek a physician to prescribe all the medicines, tests, referrals I need (or want). All Kaiser doctors can do this.</p>
<p>What I do need is a bit intangible. This is a relatively rare disease that can be tricky to diagnose; few professionals study; is often associated with conflicting symptoms (or lack of symptoms); plus has a large number of unknowns. Meanwhile the clock is ticking. I have adjusted to lifestyle changes (4-5L of urine per day for a little guy!), periodic tests, though not completely to the low-oxalate diet.</p>
<p>However, monitoring and a slow pace is not satisfactory.</p>
<p>My goal is speed up the diagnosis and treatment. What I do need is a medical advocate, an expediter, guidance in navigating medical uncertainties and medical decisions. Sometimes the holdup is me, and sometimes it is Kaiser. When it is me, it is because I do not understand the medicine, the thinking (show me the data!) or how this will lead to goal. Doctors have been quite wrong before; paths have led to more ambiguity; the years pass.</p>
<p>To put this on fast track I need to work with primary care physician who agrees.</p>
<p>If this type of challenge might appeal to you, and you have tolerance for patient raising (or seeking) data or questions, then I would be very happy to talk further to see if we are good fit.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>

<li>Seems to have done his homework, well-prepared. Lengthly phone call.</li>
<li>Seemed to understand my hesitation re: pancreatic enzymes: what problem trying to solve? Will this reduce urine Ox? What improvement in GI are we expecting w/ enzymes, given lack of symptoms now?</li>
<li>His focus seemed to be avoid stones. My focus seems to be high UrOx.</li>
<li>He admitted to have seen patients on dialysis due to high UrOx (without stones.</li>
<li>His idea: perhaps what is normal for others, is not my normal. In particular: PTHT, Urine Ca, UrOx. He also spoke with Dr.&nbsp;Lam today, and sounds like some agreement:
<ul>
<li>get CT to see if ANY stones, even small.
<ul>
<li>if none, then we might be able to assume that my current numbers are normal for ME.</li>
<li>I was hesitant. Need to learn a bit more about “everyone’s normal is differnt” and that high UrOx is not such a major concern for ME.</li>

<p>Dear Dr.&nbsp;Lam and Dr.&nbsp;Carl:</p>
<p>First, greatly appreciate your telephone calls and time and offers to assist. Apologize for delay.</p>
<p>You have brought up ideas that various factors might be related to hyperoxaluria and recent high PTH levels. I would like to learn more specifics. In particular, agreeing to a plan to systematically test your ideas would be a very big help. I want to understand the significance of the various anomalies uncovered in recent years.</p>
<p>In no particular, order here is my list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Urinary Oxalate.</li>
<li>Pancreas heath, pancreatic atrophy, stool fat.</li>
<li>Kidney health, long-term (even if absence of stones).</li>
<li>Parathyroid health.</li>
<li>GI, including possibility of bacteria (hernia) + fat malabsorption.</li>
<li>Utility of various prescriptions/supplements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Separately, I will prepare graph of 24-hour Urine Oxalate since 2014 so you can see the wide variation.</p>
<p>I am also trying to find records of Thiazide (1999-2009?), and the low Potassium and bilirubin results, till a doctor terminated the prescription.</p>

<li>Calcium Citrate Supplement - ~1000 - 1200 mg per DAY, w/o D3 (plus dairy, dietary sources). Is this working?</li>

<p>Dear Dr.&nbsp;Lam and Dr.&nbsp;Carl:</p>
<p>Anticipating our phone conversations schedduled for this month, I am collecting a few questions on my mind. This is supplement to my August 2020 note to you, but in the form of questions:</p>
<pre><code>Risks of abandoning any pretent of low-oxalae diet and return to vegetarian
    diet rich in pulses (lentils, beans) and nuts (plus the usual good
    vegetable)?

    Why?    I was heathliest on this diet; lowest lipids, glucose, best stool,
    lowest weight etc.   The diet seemed to match all the modern dietary
    information, which low-oxalate tramples upon.</code></pre>

<p>give reason. I read her the email (Mar 9 2020). Said OHSU now beginning to take patients again (Covid), but I argued my termination was nothing to do with Covid and arbitrary - long history. She calls OHSU, I am on hold… long. (total call ~ 56’) Then she gets back and says she needs to research this 5-7 days. OK. Sounds like she didn’t understand whatever OHSU said to her. Says she does not want to give me incorrect info. ?? MY reply: PLAY BY RULES: If there is supposed to be dismissal letter, why not sent? INVESTIGATE does not mean telling whatever they say as truth and CLOSE. Too bad if they didn’t like that I went after them after the first time they did this. Cathy seemed to undrestand. Wanted me to make appt with another ODS DDS, but I am not sure if that rules out returning to OHSU (assuming things can be smoothed out).</p>
<p>Voice (22 SEP 2020) from Cathy: “You were dismissed due to some behavioral difficulties. And if you want to find out more information…” Dismissal letter coming (now?) That’s an invesigation? Specifically told not to believe them anymore than she should believe me: investigate! Each time story different. This is just a madeup story!</p>

<p>Kaiser cleanings are fast! (1 hour) 3 month cleaning cycle, “perio maintenance” This is NOT “deep cleaning”, which requires anesthetic &amp; is ONE quadrant per time. I do NOT need this. CLAIM: Manual cleaning is just as good as with water drill. Due to Covid, manual is safer for dentist.Younger hygenists are taught water drill CLAIM: ACT (fluoride) is good. But Lisertine does NOT have benefit. It does kill bacteria, but when bacteria returns it uses dead as food. Hygienist didn’t think necessary to continue. CLAIM: BUTLER has better floss that won’t shred. CLAIM: G-U-M little brushes - to poke - are very good; but G-U-M tool that slides between teeth is too smooth, like GLIDE.</p>

<li><p>Since Litholink delayed (nobody watching!), Dr Carl moves telephone appt to late Dec.&nbsp;Didn’t I tell him reluctant to change date; going into queue always adds another 6 weeks; believe he said he would help.</p></li>
<li><p>So wrote yet another note to him asking him to confirm that purpose of Dec mtg to present me a plan (see letters).</p></li>
<li><p>Then, unrelatd, ultrasound people call me to schedule. OK, but they say must be done in late Dec.&nbsp;OK, so I call Kaiser nephrology nurse Laura … what is going on? She checks and says Dr.&nbsp;Lam ordered it!.<br>
</p></li>
<li><p>Give her message: people coordinate! why so hard? And made it clear to her that I expect Dec mtg to be consensus. aya … justing wasting my time.</p></li>
<li><p>Why so difficult for medical profession to work together?? Still nothing from Dr.&nbsp;Carl confirming Dec mtg. <strong>Why so hard?</strong></p></li>

<li><p>PLEASE NOTE: Pt has NO official diagnosis. Many doctors. Suspected enteric and fat malabsorption. However, symptoms often contradict diagnosis. Pancreatic atrophy is confirmed. “Theories” range from fat malabsorption, PTH (high), bacteria issue in abdominal hernia, low calcium, “you just have it”, “your body may have adjusted and this is now normal”. Pt asks if certain diet is not cause?</p></li>

<li><p>No bowel disease or bowel surgery. <br> Your NOTES are Correct.</p></li>
<li><p>High protein intake (PCR is high, 1.4g/kg/d). <br></p>
<p>Pt ate 1 can sardines (in 2 servings), nuts, beans, yogurt, cheese and too much ice cream - during test and 36 hour preceding. Pt surprised this is high protein and now asks for doctor’s guidance.</p></li>
<li><p>Pt maintains <strong>food intake log for almost all 24 hour urine tests</strong> (since</p>
<ol start="2014" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Low calcium diet <br></p>
<p>Pt skeptical. Pt says diet rich in Calcium (dairy, sardine bones, low-oxalate veg) PLUS takes CaCitrate supplements.<br>
Patient open to “clinical evaluation”.</p></li>
<li><p>Low Oxalate Diet. <br></p>
<p>Pt unable to maintain very low Ox diet, considers too unhealthy compared to normal diet. Also, results from 2014 indicate extremely low Ox diet did not bring UrOx into normal range. Has been through ‘dietary consult’ but says will gain weight and eat unhealthy foods or healthy foods (eggs) in unhealthy amounts.</p>
<p>Pt is open to diet changes – if done if controlled, precise manner. Pt willing to minimize all dietary oxalate, below tolerable, for testing purposes. Pt wants to know how long BEFORE beginning 24-hour urine test to refrain from Oxalate.</p></li>
<li><p>Change diet repeat 6-12 weeks. <br> Pt willing to do. Again asks for pre-test TIME needed for high-protein or high oxalate to clear urine.</p></li>
<li><p>Primary Hyperoxalura - <br></p>
<p>Pt has been tested (Mayo Clinic trial) and urine tests (Ore Health-Science U OHSU chromatography) negative. (Exact details unknown.)</p></li>
<li><p>Urine glycolate and glycerate measurements. DNA testing. <br> Pt has no objection.</p></li>
<li><p>Low Urine Citrate. <br></p>
<p>Pt confirms adherence to KCitrate 4 x 10MET per day (compliance &gt; 95%) and CaCitrate 1000mg -1200mg per day (compliance &gt; 95%)</p>
<p>Pt is looking offline historic Urine Citrate 24 levels - PRE KCitrate. Feels certain that in 2014 level was low that KCitrate added. Recalls results calibrated with 3 x 10 MET before doctor decided to go with 4x10 MET per day, unchanged to this day.</p>
<p>Latest eGFR = 53 (Eastern European origin)</p>
<p>Pt willing to increase dose and <strong>retest in 6 weeks, as suggested</strong> (early Jan 2021).</p></li>

<p>14 JAN 2021</p>
<p>Dear Dr.&nbsp;Asplin:</p>
<p>We corresponded in May 2019 re: Hyperoxaluria. I am Litholink patient with secondary Hyperoxaluria with no diagnosis. Dr Daniel Carl, a neprhrologist at Kaiser in Portland, Ore, will contact you shortly. I hope you will have time to review recent Litholink reports with him and also discuss my questions.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>23 NOV 2020 - Collection and Litholink Report<br>
13 JAN 2021 - Collection (repeat, increased KCitrate, very low diet Ox, low protein)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Litholink report: 23 Nov 2020 collection<br>
You should have my comments on this report, in particular references to high protein diet, low calcium diet, adherence to KCitrate, urine pH, and of course UrOx. Appreciate if you review.</p>
<p>Note: May 2020 Vitamin D3 supplement decreased from 25,000IU per week to 15,000 IU per week. (PTH did not drop with higher dose.)</p></li>
<li><p>Variation in UrOx? Please see Graph.<br>
Several values are from Litholink, the remainder from Kaiser Lab. Please comment on variation in values. Can you refer us to a reference which discusses variation of urine oxalate and significance?</p></li>
<li><p>Diet - Contribution to UrOx?<br>
To study effect of dietary oxalate on urinary oxalate, is it possible to set up a prescribed series of diet and sequence of 24-hour urine tests? Clinical trials appear to use this method. Can you refer us to a reference to describe how to do this?</p></li>
<li><p>Because the urinary oxalate is so variable, pt feels can not single out any one value and conclude “we are heading in right direction” or “improvement over last time.”</p>
<p>Do you agree? Can you suggest a testing procedure?</p></li>
<li><p>Dr Carl of Kaiser will ask you about pancreatic enzymes. Please understand Pt is skeptical because symptoms of fat malabsorption are missing: no diarrhea, no malnutrition. Will pancreatic enzymes affect urinary oxalate and if so by how much? Again, do you have reference?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are many more specific questions, but guidance on these topics would be wonderful start.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<li>No team. Stop saying it. Left and Right never on same page.</li>

<li>I do not want to play this GAME. 1000s of emails. Dr.&nbsp;Tai doesn’t realize; she is END_of_LINE.

<p>The purpose of this is to be sure we are all on the same page. I would be grateful if Dr.&nbsp;Lieske is willing to temporarily provide guidance and/or options.</p>
<p>The intermediate goal is a correct diagnosis of why I have hyperoxaluria. The longer term goal is how to minimize UrOx itself and protect against associate risks of excess oxalate. Can we see measurable results by June 1 ? ***</p>
<p>This list below is by topic, not chronology. Some items may be appear as repeats because I either did not grasp the answer or have questions. The first several refer mostly to Dr.&nbsp;Asplin (Litholink) and then to Dr.&nbsp;Lieske (Mayo)</p>

<li>Where we are now?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Latest Litholink (with very low dietary oxalate) suggests these paths:</li>
<li>DIET: Is bulk of hyperoxaluria explained by DIET?!<br>
</li>
<li>Remainder of UrOx, is there a hidden genetic possibility?</li>
<li>GI/Fat malabsorption - clearly I have problem here, but how does the data explain UrOx?</li>

<p>Dear Barb: Attached please find: 1. Very latest Litholink report (Feb 2021) 2. Current prescription list 3. List of <strong>prior</strong> hyperoxaluria suggestions.</p>

<p>For Dr.&nbsp;Lieske - for use during phone call (Will not make sense otherwise)</p>
<p><strong>PRIOR</strong> Hyperoxaluria theories</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Take more calcium</li>
<li>“You just have it” [hyperoxaluria]</li>
<li>Take more D3 to reduce PTH [didn’t]</li>
<li>Surgery may fix PTH ( and hyperoxaluria ?)</li>
<li>If ‘stone burden’ is low (via CT scan), conclude hyperoxaluria is ‘normal’ for you.</li>
<li>“clinically not possible” [fat malabsorption without diarrhea]</li>
<li>“unique”</li>
<li>“Your body may have adjusted” [to pancreas atrophy without diarrhea]</li>
<li>Variance in UrOx is in ‘normal range’ [for people with enteric hyperoxaluria}</li>
<li>You may have hidden generic factor, not one of common ones.</li>
<li>You may have TWO causes: pancreatic atrophy AND abdominal hernia bacteria, which just balance so no diarrhea, no malnutrition, no symptoms.</li>
</ol>
<p>FACT: Colonoscopy prep increasing difficult (over years) to completely empty. FACT: Last one: 7-day liquid diet; not empty; ~36’ to empty during procedure. FACT: At time, GI doctor nothing amiss and that I was just “slow”. FACT: Much later, came two-cause hyperoxaluria theory: so patient not sure if possible or just another theory. Dr suggested pancreatic enzymes, but patient unclear benefit, how prove or disprove theory, or affect hyperoxaluria.</p>

<li><p>Per Ralph Nader, applying MESH after hernia surgery is US medicine making money. Sounds simple, but high rate (number is ?) of followup pain, permanent pain, need to redo or remove.</p></li>

<p>Dear Tina:</p>
<p>Thank you for your time today, as well as in early January.</p>
<p>As you know, I have become a frequent user of Litholink. As a result, I have learned some of the rough parts and unwritten rules, at least from the patient’s perspective.</p>
<p>Today I spent 3 1/2 hours fighting with just about everyone, just for a courtesy blood draw for a 24-hour urine collection. Something is wrong; I hope we do not repeat this.</p>
<p>Here are few general and specific observations, which I hope will be benefit as you revise your forms and procedures:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Doctors are not gods.</li>
<li>Patients are not children.</li>
<li>Patients may sometimes be right.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>First, I encourage you look at your own data. Where do problems appear? Patient error? 3rd party lab error and so forth.</p></li>
<li><p>For 24-hour urine, separate directions for people using 1 jug vs 2 jugs. Standardize all terminology, fonts and so forth. Put all the papers in a single, well-indexed pamphlet.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove doctors who can not follow rules. You should know who these are; ditto for 3rd party labs.</p></li>
<li><p>Today, from just about everyone, I heard that there was to be no blood draw because the doctor did not order it. Well, see RULE 3. Your telephone support staff needs to know this .</p></li>
<li><p>We discussed having your own staff go through the test, fasting, including some procedural hiccup that forces them to sit around (hungry) for extra hour or two.</p></li>
<li><p>Today, the 3rd party lab (Kaiser) told me they never provide serum/blood tube. Please put this requirement clearly into writing so there will be no need to call Security when patient exercises RULE 3. (Am I the ONLY one with this problem, again please consult your own data.)</p></li>
<li><p>Should you have an orientation for new 3rd party labs??</p></li>
<li><p>Release the results to patient when ready. See RULE 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Make the serum draw mandatory part of the procedure, unless doctor makes specific OPT-OUT. Similarly mandate the blood tube be labeled with patient’s name and DATE of draw (Unbelievable, but this does not always happen.)</p></li>
<li><p>Plenty more but hope this gets you started.</p></li>
<li><p>Next to examining your data, RULE #3 is the most important and your procedures need to allow for this.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider removing today’s doctor from your approved list.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know if I can clarify any of this or review your revisions.</p>

<li>now about 8 weeks on pancreatic enzymes.</li>
<li>same subjective comments as before: seems less bloating, better stool.</li>
<li>April litholink - showed no effect on UrOx (even with better diet ??)</li>
<li>June - will speak with Dr.&nbsp;Lieske (Mayo); believe he wants another 24-hour urine.</li>
<li>fyi, small weight loss! maybe 3-4 pounds and continuing to fall. Weight now: 146 1/2. Adult life always &gt; 150, <strong>EXCEPT with vigorous exercise</strong> (indoor rowing); diet and gym insufficient to reduce weight.</li>
<li>per Dr.&nbsp;Lieke renewed effort to be on low-oxalate diet. In practice, however, this means more <strong>JUNK</strong> ice cream, bread, sugar has replaced dense,nutritious foods like beans, soy, nuts, boiled high fiber, whole grains kernels, one pound of leafy vegetables per day.</li>
<li>not eager, but if you need evidence that enzymes actually doing anything, very willing to any of these; Colonoscopy, kidney x-ray, Sitz test. As you know, first two have had difficulty.</li>

<li>Phone w/ Dr.&nbsp;Bilbao: she requested this appt, blocked Litholink order until this. Also blocked changes to brain meds until appt. Her call is 10’ late.<br>
</li>
<li>Today, sjfd;sonly discuss litholink order, Dr.&nbsp;Lieske. No discusion of psychiatric meds. Out of time.<br>
</li>
<li>Today: does not read email. So spend time finding July 2, 2021 med update I sent. Then no review of it.</li>
<li>Dr.&nbsp;Carl: seems very interested in why not working with him; repeats a few times, until I said ‘not qualified’ or most doctors see ONE case like this in a lifetime.</li>
<li>Then I need to review whole history with Dr.&nbsp;Lieske and pancreatic enzymes. She has no medical info, appears to be using the time only to get up to speed. Again repeats, more than once, that emails are at her own time and best way to communicate is: voice.<br>
</li>
<li>No mention that we did TRY to do this; she had dropped the ball. Guess burden is on patient to track down doctor.</li>
<li>More than once says she really wants to help. Wants to go beyond … really? News to me … you’ve been out of picture, now you re-insert yourself.</li>
<li>So we finally get to Litholink…. Takes awhile to (AGAIN) explain how Litholink wants it done: patient does legwork, after doctor signs. Here is where trouble begins. At least 2 points, I said I don’t know what doctor sees: please call Litholink.</li>
<li>Can’t send signed copy electronically; does not want to send signature on blank piece of paper (isn’t it a form)? So she insists she will fill it out/fax to them. (No mention about long prior delays; does say she’ll do it Tuesday when she’s back at office.)</li>
<li>Next I raise 10-day hold on Litholink results. Insists that way she will do it is: wait for paper copy of results (will not go on online and release it), Then she (or assistant) takes picture (?) and uploads to their system. Patient can not see this uploaded file, so she (or assistant) can then MAIL me the photo or whatever it is. Can not do it electronically. Explained I need this to give to outside doctor.</li>
<li>Team: at some point, I objected this word. I don’t see any team.</li>
<li>She seems to like to summarize things by ADDING in things that I did not agree to. So I have to unwind it, example: I don’t know why this or why that … and try to push burden on her to, for example, call Litholink for any details.</li>
<li>Seems to present this is as <code>choice</code>. I reply I am not your boss, but not happy with such a manual system; especially given the actual DATA there are all kinds of delays. Says she wants to do all she can to help, but is at her limit. She notes that both of us seem to betting upset. (Yeah, you claim to do all you can, but want to strictly adhere to system that introduces ADDITIONAL delays. In past, I had to call Litholink to get things to move: but I did not say this.)</li>
<li>Now I am pissed. She repeats no time for emails. Think she said she will review Lieske’ notes or whatever, but I am not convinced … She rather proceed by telephone call (with me).</li>
<li>ZERO discussion of Wellbutrin.</li>
<li>I get off phone and call Kaiser to change doctors. Denise Bilbao has not proven herself very effective at anything, except delaying. Out of time.</li>

<p>From the paper:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In cases that do not respond to initial treatment, the doses can be doubled, and proton inhibitors can be added to the treatment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you agree?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) can be defined as a reduction in pancreatic enzyme activity in the intestinal lumen to a level that is below the threshold required to maintain normal digestion. This concept is crucial ….</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Debate</strong></p>
<p>Of course, I would like to know both sides of this.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The need for PERT in PEI without symptoms is a matter of debate, and randomized clinical trials on this issue are lacking.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, certain collateral evidence supports PERT, even in the absence of overt steatorrhea and weight loss: (1) A longitudinal study in patients with CP demonstrated that patients with no clinical symptoms of steatorrhea but an abnormal steatocrit who did not receive PERT lost more weight than not only CP patients with a normal steatocrit but also patients with an abnormal steatocrit and symptoms of steatorrhea who were treated with PERT[63]; (2) Laboratory signs of malnutrition have been demonstrated in a large proportion of patients with CP and asymptomatic steatorrhea who were not under treatment with PERT[64].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you agree blood tests can indicate malnutitrion prior to other symptoms appearing?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It is reasonable to assume that such malnutrition-related complications will be preceded by deficiencies of macro- or micronutrients detectable by routine blood tests…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>…The central conclusion that can be drawn from this study [see paper] is that a normal panel of serum nutritional markers can exclude PEI with a high negative predictive value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This theory has been floating for post 2-3 years. Your analysis?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If PERT is ineffective despite an increased dose and adjuvant treatment with PPI, the diagnosis of PEI should be revised, and possible coexisting and/or alternative reasons for maldigestion, such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, should be considered.</p>

<p>Please recall our conversation ~ 29 APRIL 2021. We agree to verify 15 APRIL 2021 Litholink. That 24-hour urine report, the first WITH Zenpep enzymes, showed slight UrOx increase vs prior non-enzyme report.</p>
<p>Note the recent U/S which shows NEW stone that did not exist in prior U/S (DEC 2020)</p>
<p>And finally my graph comparing fecal fat to total fecal weight in 3 72-hour fecal fat tests. The third is WITH Zenpep.</p>

<p>8 JUN 2022</p>
<p>Dear Dr.&nbsp;Jhansale:</p>
<p>Just a followup to our conversation last Friday (3 JUNE).</p>
<p>We agreed to do the following:</p>
<p><strong>ZENPEP</strong></p>
<p>Appears to be little evidence of improved UrOx with Zenpep, continued use of medicine does not seem warranted. As a test, I will taper Zenpep to zero pills per day. In mid-August (~60 days), I will repeat 24-hour urine (Litholink) and review with you.</p>
<pre><code>-   The official textbook treatment of pancreatic atrophy, which I have, are use
    of these type of enzymes.  Indeed there **was a reduction in fecal fatty acid**.
    The issue is that no other benefit was observed.  The usual symptoms
    (diarhea) never applied.   One doctor(GI, left Kaiser) said to follow the
    science (textbook), another (Pancreas, left Kaiser) said my "body may have
    adjusted" to lack of enzymes.  Two others (Litholink and Mayo) observed
    that sometimes symptoms (diarhea) do not appear and (Mayo) in some  people (a few, a
    couple ?) enzymes do not reduce UrOx.

-   Separately, I will update chart of all my UrOx numbers (since 2014) and send copy to you.

-   The long term health effect having little to no pancreatic enzymes is UNKNOWN to me.
-   The long term effects, however, of UrOx is **NOT benign** (medical literature).
    No doctor been able to provide clarity or effect prevention.</code></pre>
<p><strong>Effexor</strong></p>
<p>Will begin 1/2 dose (~ 1 week when I get the medicine) for 30 days (to mid July). Will report any significant changes immediately to you. If all goes well, will be using only Wellbutrin going foward, till we review. - Am aware your experience with Effexor for mental health has been not been as successful. However, I feel I must report that beginning with Effexor, followed soon after by Wellbutrin, in 2014 ended all reported symptoms. I have been very stable since and feel I am fully functional, albeit still unemployed.</p>
<pre><code>-   Said another way should I miss the Effexor, I would have no objection to
resuming.</code></pre>
<p><strong>Litholink</strong></p>
<pre><code>-   Suggestion:   Would it be easier if I prepared the Litholink form and then
send it to you electonically? (in late July) 
-   If yes,  appreciate if you then (1) sign it (2) fax it Litholink (number on
form) and (3) be sure to prepare "Courtesy Blood Draw" request for Kaiser Lab.
Eugene lab is not strict on this, but Portland/Salem are extremely strict - no
form, no work, no negotiation (they have called Security on me).
-   Second Suggestion:  Given the persistent HIGH UrOx numbers, I hope you would
be willing to speak directly to Litholink's medical head.  Litholink sits atop
a vast treasure of urine and kidney stone data.  I spoke with this person,
but I feel you, a doctor, might make more progress.  (If yes, I will need to
prepare you with questions).   This is not an immediate need.
-   Please recall that last litholink (2 May 2022) leaked urine, but the lab did
do the blood work.  We have the report.
-   I think did a SECOND 24-hour urine (blood+urine) and sent this to Litholink.
There is still no report.</code></pre>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Jim</p>

<li>First week or so, at 5 or 6 per day, stomach got a little angry: gas, slight discomfort; no diarerha. Still regularly; daily. After week or so, stomach calmed down. Now everything seems very good shape.</li>
<li>But UrOx, stones, fat in stool – no idea.</li>

<p>Dr Jhansale:</p>
<p><strong>Update: VENLAFAXINE 37.5, Zenpep, Litholink</strong></p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>June 18, 2022 (Zenpep): Last day of use (now zero) (Stool normal, regular, no sign of digestive issues at all)</li>
<li>June 24, 2022 (VENLAFAXINE): First day on 1/2 dose (37.5 mg)</li>
<li>July 22 (Next telephone appt:) review VENLAFAXINE</li>
<li>August 21 (Next Litholink) evaluate 60 days without Zenpep (I will provide you with paperwork, early July)</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional Notes: <strong>Itching</strong> With 2-3 days of zero Zenpep itching began on all 4 limbs, abdomen, thighs, neck, groin &amp; shoulders. No signs of skin rashes. But can’t seem to stop.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong> Joined local Y. First real exercise in 800+ days (aside from pushups, jumping jacks, daily 10000 steps). Main exercise is indoor rowing machine (poor man’s MRI + exercise) b/c of deep breathing. Past benefits rowing return, including mental health.</p>
<p><strong>Litholink - new result: Urox 45</strong> Litholink results (May 11, 2022) - I just rec’d these results. Full Zenpep, Calcium, KCitrate etc. UrOx = 45, no special diet (ie NOT low-oxalate) stunned. Did Zenpep have effect or not? Will review with you July 22.</p>
<p><strong>VENLAFAXINE &amp; Insurance</strong> For years, insurance paid. Refused to pay for 1/2 dose (37.5 mg)! “not in formulary” (I paid $26.15+ for 30 pills). Ins company now faxing you forms they need to approve.</p>
<p>Thank you. Looking forward to more rowing.</p>

<p><strong>Itching</strong> - Drew blood today (shoulder) - 1 week; began a few days AFTER last dose of ZENPEP. - Began BEFORE reduced Venfalaxone (37.5); BEFORE joining Y; - trimmed nails; wet cloth on wrist (instead of scratching) - thighs, groin, arms, legs; not backh - No shirt, seems to help, actually. - No sign of rash or yellow or skin issue - With movement: no itching problem.<br>
- Sleeping: no itching problem: - <strong>Sitting or Stationary: This is problem.</strong> - https://blog.dana-farber.org/insight/2020/02/is-itching-a-sign-of-pancreatic-cancer/</p>

<p>Resumed Zenpep today. - No change in itching to date. - Today, discussed with doctor on call (?) or via the nurse? - They made appt for me: next week.</p>
<p>On theory that loss of Zenpep caused problem, goal is to see if problem goes away WITH RESUMPTION. If not, stop again, seems to be no harm.</p>
<ul>
<li>longer walk; some gas; stomach seems to be transitioned (as I recall from before);</li>
<li>As soon as sit down, massive scratching …</li>

<li><pre><code>                          ZENPEP full (11 tablets) dose.</code></pre>
<p>-`Itching started 3 days BEFORE change in efforex.</p></li>
<li></li>
<li><p>Misc Notes:</p></li>
<li><p>poor sleep; (itching)</p></li>
<li><p>To sleep or stop itching: a/c - very cold, sleep under desk.</p></li>
<li><p>itching resumes as soon as awake.</p></li>
<li><p>Getting worse? don’t think so, but tolerance/patience has sharply decreased.</p></li>
<li><p>Unable to most common tasks: cook, type, work … just want to lie down; Not because tired; but sleep is only way to get relief from itching.</p></li>
<li><p>So many 2nd affects; eating poorly, trouble hydrating … just rather lie down, doze. No desire to do any work. Not like depression; just losing battle with the itching. Tired of splashing water; rubbing in Hydrocortizone.</p></li>
<li><p>Today bought coffee (none yesterday - rare, very rare); will make effort to WALK to Y (did not go yesterday).</p></li>
<li><p>AFTER Y, long walk, exercise, shower - ALL good, no itch. Hot sun on skin - no itch. Effect lasts couple of hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Hyrdorcortizone 1% - works IF apply frequently, hourly? And must apply asap - before really scratch.</p></li>
<li><p>Trim NAILS! but not so much that Nails hurt. Tricky.</p></li>

<li><p>Suspects NOT related to Zenpep (or efforex or …)</p></li>
<li><p>He is not certain: might be SCABIES, which has <code>simple</code> treatment.</p></li>
<li><p>Treat ONE night; but still takes several days or more for ITCH to die down (Itch is body’s response to this mite &amp; its determinents)</p></li>
<li><p>ALSO, says VERY DRY SKIN, recommends OTC lotions for dry skin. (I buy Avenno something.)</p></li>
<li><p>To reduce ITCH sensation, recommends ANTI-HISTOMINE. However, I see warnings about kidneys - is this one of no-no medicines? So I do not buy;</p></li>
<li><p>Stay with Hydrocordizone 1%.</p></li>
<li><p>IF CONDITION CONTINUES … then will send me to DERMITOLOGY for possile STERIOD use. Does NOT want to use STERIOD till clearer picture. Makes sense to me.</p></li>
<li><p>With a/c | with aggressive Hydrocordizone - before deep ITCH | and sprinkle bit of water | exercise; I think I can manage.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>SCABIES - ITCH = PRURITIS (other possible causes) - Die after 2-3 days without human skin! - But can live 1-2 months ON a person - Isolate clothes, towels in plastic …. or wash hot water, hot dryer. (in car, in plastic, T &gt; 50C, or 122 F, takes 10 min to kill) - Usually passed human-human skin contact (10 minutes or more) - Where did I get this??<br>
- TIME to CLEAN CAR! - 14 days for egg to mature to larve/nymph - like warmer skin (groin, under the arms) - Worldwide infections are growing: example Germany 525 infections/100K peeople (1/2 %) - mostly &lt; 24 yo?</p>

<p>– NO REPLY NEEDED –</p>
<p>– <strong>re: INSURANCE DENIAL &amp; VENLAFAXINE ER HCL ER 37.5 mg TAB</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Dr.&nbsp;Jhansale:</strong></p>
<p>– Please recall our plan to REDUCE VENLAFAXINE (from 75 mg to 37.5 and then, hopefully, to ZERO)</p>
<p>– Insurance company has always paid for 75 mg, but REFUSED to pay for 37.5 (non “formulary”). You ALSO sent supplemental paperwork to them.</p>
<p>– DENIAL (date: 7/2/22) They sent you a copy as cc.</p>
<p>– <strong>IF you are too busy to deal with this, I am happy to DROP matter.</strong> (I won’t miss the $26 I paid)</p>
<p>– HOWEVER, based on cumulative experience this company, HUMANA, appears to have trouble with the most routine (banal) duties (wrong email/url addresses, denying requests b/c, they claim, unable to contact a Kaiser doctor ). I do not know if this deliberate business strategy, or simple incompetence. In fact, BOTH 75 mg and 37.5 mg appear on their formulary!</p>
<p>– REGARDLESS, I wish to document their conduct, ie one data point, and later present it to those with more clout than I do. All of this just to taper, and hopefully end, one medicine.</p>
<p>– Again, if you are too busy, I will drop it. Otherwise, I proceed to the next rung, to request “independent” review, which requires from you (see page 4 of 9 of their July 2, 2022 DENIAL):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“your prescribing doctor … must submit a statement with your appeal request indicating that all the drugs on any tier of our formulary (or the PA/UM requirement) would not be as effective to treat your condition as the requested drug, or would harm your health.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Status Now:</strong></p>
<p>Effexor: still 1/2 dose<br>
Zenpep: still full dose (11 pills)</p>
<p><strong>ITCH: Remains dominant.</strong> Can not tell if improvement or responding quicker (see below).</p>
<p><strong>What I did</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5 JUL: Saw you Tuesday 5 JUL</li>
<li>6 JUL: Medicine ready; applied head to toe: 10:30 pm for 14 hours | woke itching and reapplied small amount.</li>
<li>7 JUL: 12:30 Shower off</li>
<li>DAILY: wash skin/ treat ITCH with 1% Hydrocordizone; VASALINE: scratches; used sparingly AVEENO “Daily Moisture”, “Dry_skin”; Dimethicone 1.% (expensive)</li>
<li>DID NOT PURCHASE ANTI-HISTIMINE (recall processed through kidney; believe told to avoid)</li>
<li>Discard old pillows; isolate clothing; vaccum daily.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What works</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EXERCISE</strong></li>
<li><strong>DIRECT SUNLIGHT on skin</strong> (~ 20’ per day)</li>
<li>All the other stuff? minimal if any.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong></p>
<p>This routine works consistently :</p>
<ul>
<li>midday - WALK to YMCA (~30 minutes); en route: stand fixed in sunlight 5-10’ | exercise at Y &gt; 30 minutes | shower (not sure essential, re: itch)</li>
<li>Proceed directly to library: next 3-4 hours can <strong>focus, work, no itch, no distraction.</strong></li>
<li>ItCH certainly returns after 4 or so hours.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>skin (esp legs, ankles, bottom side of arms, thighs) still stratched and DO itch.</li>
<li>GROIN appears less inflamed.</li>
<li>Learned to respond ASAP to first ITCH with soap, water, Vasaline, % Hydro.. Reduces RISK of deep itching/scratching, but that is it. Can not FOCUS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Misc</strong></p>
<p>Fred Meyers says “a couple” of prescriptions each WEEK. each WEEK?</p>
<p>Can not identify source of SCABIES:</p>
<ul>
<li>No covid | following covid guidelines | generally very isolated.</li>
<li>NO KNOWN contact with anyone for 1’, 5’, 10’ or more.</li>
<li><em>Can I get from BUS seat? library Seat? during BLOOD Test? From cashier? From coffee cup? Door knobs? I use Asian bathroom techniques: no touch. And no sex.</em></li>

<li>Now almost 4 full weeks.</li>
<li>2nd treatment applied last 36 hours.</li>
<li>Only reduction in ITCH is temporary and seems more related to my <strong>TRICKS</strong>: direct sunlight, exercise, move, cold , apply enough lotions and potions to skin.</li>
<li>If I can get ahead of ITCH, will get few hours of relief.</li>

<ul>
<li>Can not work: sit at keyboard and suddenly find one hand in shirt/pants scratching. (Exception: see my <strong>tricks</strong>)</li>
<li>Can not sit still.</li>
<li>Sleep: no pattern. Equally likely to find me asleep at 12 midnight, 12 Noon, neither, or both.</li>

<li>HEAD: lessening, but any sudden movement/motion yields momentary dizzy/lightheaded/blood swish; still every day; WITH vigorous exercise decreses (+ days)</li>
<li>SKIN: clueless what is going on. Groin still red; face spots still there;<br>
</li>
<li>MEDICNE: nothing from Dr J, re: pro/con; status of shampoo. concentrtion too low to reduce further.</li>
<li>AIR CONDITIONING: Strongly suspect a/c in office does not lead to good heath: - Sleep much better in car. - Nap in rooom; throat will be very dry; once or twice painfully dry; ditto nose. - cold, no I’m hot; no now it is blowing on me. - Result: Minimize time in office. Just not right place. (library: far, far better, none of above complaints.)</li>

<p>BLOAT - HOW could I forgt this? - past 5-7 days, stomach, BLOAT - What did I EAT? - hungry, but no room; gas? full? - happens 3-5 hours after eating; right where I have hernia. - Big pressure - Seems like `right where hernia is. - Gonna explode! - Psyllium does help. - Walking does not help. Often hungry! - 146 lb (shoes only) weight at gym</p>
<p>Status: Are you on I on same page?</p>
<p>OVERALL - Still not 100% (or 90%) since day before scabies began ( ~ June 17, 2022).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ITCH - No itching, or very minor, since cessation (~ July 18, 2022)</p></li>
<li><p>HEAD (or bp) sudden movement triggers momenatary dizzines| sensation of internal fluid sloshin about | bp shift?. Forces cessation of all activity, but disapates quickly (10 seconds or so).<br>
</p></li>
<li><p>EMOTIONS - Unambiguous, clear change in ease to anger| irritated | become confused| mood | grouchy. ALSO can be brief but strong emtionally response. Temporary (minutes to hours), but prounced ability to concentrate; sort things out (even as simple as cleaning my desk) | mood. These are NEW, unmistakable. (~ since July 18, 2022 - effexor). Once triggered requires physical change to mitigate (ie leave librar)</p></li>
<li><p>EXERCISE - vigorous exercise (not walking) such as rowing 30 minutes or more is PROTECTIVE to above HEAD and EMOTIONS. Noted decrease in symptoms and intensity in days following vigorous exericse, but not to ZERO.</p></li>
<li><p>CDC - called me! Part of V-safe vaccine followup. I reported decrease in health (all of this) though clearly stated did not think covid-19 related. Suspect scabies or health DECREASE caught attention.</p></li>
<li><p>INSURANCE - clueless why rejecting what was previouly approved or what to do about it. [your office replied today - but I DO NOT THINK issue is WHICH phamacy I get prescriptions refilled. Humana is objecting to SPEFIC presriptions] Selinium - as diluted as I can go.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Appreciate your attention to these items:</p>
<p>From 21 JULY 2022 report at doctor’s office: - Vaccines: (non-Covid) Am I up-to-date? Td? POLIO?? - Labs: Lipids! (LDL/HDL/Tri….) Please add.</p>
<ul>
<li>Colonscopy - now 5 years - It is time. (Kaiser doctor who made recommendation is no longer at KP)</li>
</ul>
<p>LITHOLINK: - Per our plan of early JUNE (prior to scabies), repeat 24-hour urine WITHOUT ZENPEP (enyzeme) to review WHAT, IF ANY , UrOx changes. - Also per discussion, would appreciate you review specific questions with new Litholink lab director.</p>

How many times fix this!! - <strong>delayed</strong> response to removing Efforex. Why the FUCK DIDN’T YOU JUST SAY :THIS weeks ago. Why do i need to go threw SOME MUCH work????&gt; - 1 month+ since I reported symptoms to her. (Effexor ended 7/23/2022 - the plan had been to taper and if no issues after 30 days, drop it. I assumed she meant issues would appear on the tapered dose. WRON. WRONGG) -</p>

<li><p>Bloating; I repeatedly said I do am not the doctor; no longer want to self-medicate. Can not determine if food, absence of Zenpep, or even Effexor! She wants to colloprate. I said ALL BETS off this summer. I am wrong too often. You are doctor. (Implicit - and YOU need to followup)</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tue-30-aug2022-review-of-your-notes">Tue 30 Aug2022 review of your notes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for your time; feel got some things addressed yesterday, in-person.</li>
<li>your notes differ slightly from my recollection but seem to “minor” errors or differences. For exact symptoms, timing, order of events, I prefer to refer to emails.</li>
<li>we did NOT address 2nd major topic: dizzy, fear of falling, headaches, bp surges. <strong>I ASSUME covered by resumption of Effexor. </strong></li>
<li>I now have strong preference of in-office visits ONLY. No emails. no telephone. Do not wish to use more than my fair share of your time, but I see the in-house visit is much more efficient than strings of emails, calls ….</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><p>Here is a very specific, concrete example why.</p>
<p>Although you did remind me to monitor and report mood changes as I tappered Effexor from 75mg to 37.5 mg to zero; the first hint of trouble came in July 26 email, some 4 days after Efforex was gone. I accept blame: I clearly wrote: NO REPLY NEEDED. At the time I was far more worried about skin, skin scrappings, scabies. I had assumed, rightly or wrongly, that any Effexor related mood shifts would have occurred long before.</p>
<p>But that July 26 email clearly records the problems I would I would endure through present.</p>
<p>I think an excellent example of why patients should not self-medicate. ***************</p></li>
<li><p>Accordingly, I request two-week followup NOT be by phone. But in-person. If you approve, then I’d appreciate if you or your staff just pick day and time and I will be there - no need for confirmmatinos, more telephone calls.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, I thank you for your time and understanding.</p></li>

<li><p>Chronic high UrOx - Using different regions of the spectrum from #2, what are the long term health risks? Is there any such “safe” level of UrOx?</p></li>
<li><p>Standard Treatment for Enteric Hyperoxaluria seems to be K+ Citrate (prevent stones), Calcium Citrate and DIET. What is spectrum of benefits (percentage reduction in UrOx).</p></li>
<li><p>DIET - If diet is suspected, how can this be verified? Is there benefit to putting patient on controlled diet of low/high oxalate?</p></li>
<li><p>Labs, such as Litholink - Are there any (anonymous) studies that associate UrOx with other factors?</p></li>

<p>re: <strong>Appeal Number 1-11710713263</strong></p>
<p>ROTHSTEIN, JAMES 831-824-4304 jimrothstein@gmail.com</p>
<p>This is a written request for appeal to Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).</p>
<p>Humana: Plan ID 113 (please see attached OMHA-100 form)</p>
<p>I challenge Humana’s October 19, 2022 “appeal decision is unfavorable”. In particular, I question the statement “we did not receive the requested information.” I will present evidence that Humana did, in fact, receive requested information.</p>
<p>If Humana needed additional information, not previously requested, I am (1) unaware of such a request and (2) skeptical the doctor involved did not comply.</p>
<p>At the hearing, I will also supply receipts and do seek reimbursement.</p>
<p>The very crux of this matter is that doctor and I felt I should tapper the medicine dose and, if successful, reduce the dose to ZERO. That is correct stop taking the medicine.</p>
<p>I look forward to addressing these concerns during the hearing.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>FACE: left and right side, most likely benign; right has slight pinkish; treatments I now have (scalp) won’t work, leave it alone.</p>
<p>Psoriasis: CAN leave it alone, provide no spread or worsening; I said I’d be more aggressive, which WORKED before.</p>
<p>CALCIUM - spike in urine; refer to Dr.&nbsp;LAM; discussed diuretic but reported need for K ~ 20 years ago, he dropped it.</p>
<p>VENLAFAXINE - ‘notorious’ for hard to taper, some patients need boost of ??? (serotonin) to balance remove of VENLAFAXINE</p>
<p>Pneumonia shot: every 10 years. no after effects, slight arm soreness.</p>
