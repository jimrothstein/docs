re: Can you review my medical chart for past weeks?


=== Background:   Two colonoscopies, brutal prep, and an ER

Yesterday, SUN Nov 9, I was released from Kaiser West Side Hospital
after a full week of 2 colonosocopies (yes, 2), a visit to ER and
hospitalization.

I went to ER Sat Nov 8 because I was not recovering from
colonoscopies/prep the way I had in past. (Had up to 9,10 of these since
age 48?).  This prep was by far the longest and most difficult. (since
mid-October?  or was it early September?)  Since I was due to return
to Eugene, the ER visit was to verify my lack of well-being due to
dehydration or extended absence of food/nutrition.

Indeed the ER, did find very low K+ levels and immediately gave me K+
pills and began an IV with K; I also saw  very high BP, also  noted
during the colonoscopy procedure.  I did not present any issues
associated with punctuated colon (as contrast, see ER, from colonoscopy #1 2024 at
Peace Health in Springfield), but I also did not know Colonoscopy #4
(Friday) had had extensive bleeding requiring staples.  (Other than
"success", and "Your ride is here", I do not recall paperwork, diet
advice, warnings, discussion or even when the next one would be.
If this was discussed, it did not register)


=== Gallbladder

The ER also found an "angry" gallbladder, verified by CT Scan +
ultrasound.  I went to the ER without any abdominal complaints, but every
doctor afterwards thought this was original motivation. 


Apparently, the situation did indicate removal ( I was talking to
surgeons at this point.)  But after more complete discussion the
(1) importance of fat (diary) to maintain a lower-oxalate diet and (2)
pancreatic insufficiency without enzymes (see MAYO notes), the
assigned surgeon (Dr. Vivan Wang) agreed there could be unintended
consequences.

=== Who is the Chef?

Finally, the first real meal in two weeks (hospital food!) was absolutely
wonderful, just like I cook! (Who is the chef?)

With absence of any pain, the doctor-in-charge said 'go home'.


=== My concerns now:

- Recover from this "prep", including K+, strength etc.
- Is gallbladder now "happy" and not "angry",  with normal wall thickness?
- Protect kidneys
- Help to maintain low-oxalate diet WITHOUT adding carbohydrates and WITHOUT annoyed the gallbladder.



=== How did this happen?

The entire colonoscopy fiasco should be reviewed by Kaiser's money
people.  You are not saving any money/staff time or doing to justice
to the patient when 4 colonoscopies and 1 ER visit are needed instead
of 1 boring colonoscopy.  When patient says preps rarely work, doctors
need to listen carefully.  And stop with the "Your ride is here" - you
cause more problems.


=== The Odds

I have known about gallstones for 15 years.  I find the odds that gallbladder gets "angry" less than 1 day after colonoscopy to be  so small that:

*Can not be unrelated, independent events*







SUN 16 NOV 2025 - Colonoscopy - What an ordeal!
7 NOV - 2nd colonoscopy - success
8 NOV - ER/hospital
9 NOV - release hospital, return Eugene
10 NOV (Mon) - no BM
11 NOV (T)  - BM, very light, slender, "normal"
12 NOV (W)  - BM, bit more
13 NOV (R)  - do not feel right, 4 pm - bamm - big mud pile in pants!; many BM
14 NOV (F)  - BM every couple hours; nothing stays
15 NOV (Sa) - less BM, but still can stay
16 NOV (S) - better, eating, stays in;   


Monday 1 DEC 2025 - 2nd 24 hour of year (Kaiser) (4200 ml) fasting
- diet includes assorted healthy items, but also ...
- beans, 1 collard green, brown rice, assorted lettuce mix; dairy; 

Friday, 26 DEC 2025 - STOOL
Past week or so ... perfect stools!  swollen, single piece, elongated (> 6" - 10"?).
What happened? more psyillium? more potatoes? (white +  sweet)? Increased rowing?
OR, Less peanuts/peanut butter?



Tuesday, 5 Jan 2026  - STOOL
Gee ... just about every STOOL fit same pattern:   swollen, elongated, 1 big piece.
Until today.... chunks.    Yesterday, I ate #strong[peanut butter and ice cream], too much.

Thursday 8 Jan 2026  - *STOOL*
- With amble Psyllium,  elongated stool returns.  Need to Watch.

- Jan 22 visit to Dr.  Medicare B includes, free, "Wellness" check,
  including eval for dementia; also blood test for genetic colon
  cancer risk (has this been done?  may only be for normal risk
  people?)



#pagebreak()

For January 22, 2026
Wellness Check


= Follow Medicare B guidelines
If I drift off, we'll never finish.


= Status:

== No pressing issues. \
But GI has number of long-term, sometimes overlapping conditions.  Historically (~ 10 years or more), GI most expensive, time-intensive procedures/tests/doctors. Many fail but little "knowledge" gained.  

=== Examples
+ pancreas (atrophy, large number of cysts,  known ~3 years)
+ gallbladder (stones ~12 years, only event:   within hours of Nov '25, colonoscopy #4 and very extended prep)
+ oxalate (controlled, ~15 years;  too many doctors don't know; never full explanation)

=== Current doctors:
+ Dr. Lam (Kaiser) - urology
+ Dr. Miyake (Kaiser)  - nephrology
+ GI - many, Need one on continuing  basis



== Blood Pressure 
controlled by medication *and* rowing (other exercise does not work )
arteriosclerosis ?   (See date ?) 

== Osteoporosis 
- Next X-ray,
- next infusion?

== Dietician (Jan 27)
How to  balance oxalate, gallbladder and nutrition?

== Sleep
Recently (< 1 year) becoming an issue.
Cold + exercise improves sleep.

= Other Medicare B issues

= Seek
Seek:  single GI doctor for overall review,  on-going guidance, prevention, planning. \
Seek:  Reduce mental health medication?
