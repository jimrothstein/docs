re: Can you review my medical chart for past weeks?


=== Background:   Two colonoscopies, brutal prep, and an ER

Yesterday, SUN Nov 9, I was released from Kaiser West Side Hospital
after a full week of 2 colonosocopies (yes, 2), a visit to ER and
hospitalization.

I went to ER Sat Nov 8 because I was not recovering from
colonoscopies/prep the way I had in past. (Had up to 9,10 of these since
age 48?).  This prep was by far the longest and most difficult. (since
mid-October?  or was it early September?)  Since I was due to return
to Eugene, the ER visit was to verify my lack of well-being due to
dehydration or extended absence of food/nutrition.

Indeed the ER, did find very low K+ levels and immediately gave me K+
pills and began an IV with K; I also saw  very high BP, also  noted
during the colonoscopy procedure.  I did not present any issues
associated with punctuated colon (as contrast, see ER, from colonoscopy #1 2024 at
Peace Health in Springfield), but I also did not know Colonoscopy #4
(Friday) had had extensive bleeding requiring staples.  (Other than
"success", and "Your ride is here", I do not recall paperwork, diet
advice, warnings, discussion or even when the next one would be.
If this was discussed, it did not register)


=== Gallbladder

The ER also found an "angry" gallbladder, verified by CT Scan +
ultrasound.  I went to the ER without any abdominal complaints, but every
doctor afterwards thought this was original motivation. 


Apparently, the situation did indicate removal ( I was talking to
surgeons at this point.)  But after more complete discussion the
(1) importance of fat (diary) to maintain a lower-oxalate diet and (2)
pancreatic insufficiency without enzymes (see MAYO notes), the
assigned surgeon (Dr. Vivan Wang) agreed there could be unintended
consequences.

=== Who is the Chef?

Finally, the first real meal in two weeks (hospital food!) was absolutely
wonderful, just like I cook! (Who is the chef?)

With absence of any pain, the doctor-in-charge said 'go home'.


=== My concerns now:

- Recover from this "prep", including K+, strength etc.
- Is gallbladder now "happy" and not "angry",  with normal wall thickness?
- Protect kidneys
- Help to maintain low-oxalate diet WITHOUT adding carbohydrates and WITHOUT annoyed the gallbladder.



=== How did this happen?

The entire colonoscopy fiasco should be reviewed by Kaiser's money
people.  You are not saving any money/staff time or doing to justice
to the patient when 4 colonoscopies and 1 ER visit are needed instead
of 1 boring colonoscopy.  When patient says preps rarely work, doctors
need to listen carefully.  And stop with the "Your ride is here" - you
cause more problems.


=== The Odds

I have known about gallstones for 15 years.  I find the odds that gallbladder gets "angry" less than 1 day after colonoscopy to be  so small that:
